<p>This isn't a new idea but looking at people's code it doesn't seem to be
a particularly widely used practice: modular CSS. That's a poncy name for
the very simple idea of grouping related styles into separate
stylesheets. The same set of tasks turn up on project after project and a
little careful thought can save hours of foundation work, allowing you to
get on with the serious business of turning a flat design into a web page
far more quickly.</p>

<p>The broad groups that I use are: typography, forms, layout, navigation
and colour. These aren't set in stone and some projects require more or
less categories.</p>

<h2>Common components</h2>

<h3>Typography:</h3>
<p>Basic styles for html elements with font faces, sizes, weights and
neutral colours. Bearing in mind that colour is dealt with elsewhere
you'll probably only find you need to make minor adjustments to these
between projects &ndash; a couple of ems here and there, bold to normal
for a heading or two, that sort of thing. I limit the styles in this
sheet to root elements only &ndash; no classes or ids. Anything requiring
a class is probably going to be site-sepcific and so belongs in layout.</p>

<h3>Forms:</h3>
<p>Forms are my least favourite things to try and style - the variation
between browsers often forces lots of ugly hacks and filters and I like
to keep these separate from the rest of the CSS.</p>

<h3>Navigation:</h3>
<p>How often have you coded a horizontal nav bar? Do it once, do it well,
and reuse it. You'll need to tweak a few bits and pieces but put it in
it's own CSS file and the bulk of the work will be a copy and paste away.</p>

<h3>Layout:</h3>
<p>This is where the majority of the work lies and most of it will be unique
to the project you're working on. I use naming conventions for my common
structural elements to ease the transition between sites when it come to
maintenance but that's off-topic for this article.</p>

<h3>Colour scheme:</h3>
<p>The only properties you'll need in here are: color, background and
border-color. Nothing else. Be sure to avoid adding any layout info here
&ndash; a misplaced margin:0 can ruin your whole afternoon!</p>
<p>An added benefit of the separate colour stylesheet is that you can write
yourself a nice neutral colour scheme and avoiding 10 hours per day of
staring at the eye-searing orange that your client is insisting on.</p>

<h2>Putting them all together</h2>
<p>I use a file called screen.css but it can be whatever you like. All
you're doing here is @importing your CSS modules to make up a complete
site. The @imports cover N4 degredation so you can just &lt;link&gt; to
screen.css from your HTML.</p>
<pre>
/* typography styles */
@import url("typo.css");

/* form elements */
@import url("forms.css");

/* main layout */
@import url("layout.css");

/* navigation */
@import url("horizontal-nav.css");

/* colour scheme */
@import url("skin.css");
</pre>
<p>For your print stylesheet you might choose to just import your
typography. Rather than having a print sheet that overrides all your
layout just have it import typo.css and nothing else. Job done. What
about handheld media types? Well you might want a flexible layout but the
same typography, form styling and colour scheme. Modular CSS comes to the
rescue and you only need to code a new layout and import it into
handheld.css along with typo.css, form.css and skin.css.</p>
<p>This technique also allows you to unplug stylesheets globally from your
site without having to touch the HTML, adding a layer of abstraction
between content and style.</p>
<p>Another happy side benefit of modular CSS is in the debugging &ndash;
just comment out whole stylesheets until you isolate the problem and
focus your efforts there.</p>
<h3>Addons:</h3>
<p>You could plug in a development stylesheet with Andrew Krespanis' Global
Whitespace Reset (<a
href="http://leftjustified.net/journal/2004/10/19/global-ws-reset">Left Justified | Global White Space Reset</a>).
Before you hand over just remove the import from screen.css and you're
good to go.</p>
<p>If you find that your're reusing chunks of code from previous projects
for promo boxes of headers, consider placing them in their own stylesheet
for easier access later.</p>
<h2>A word of caution</h2>
<p>The more stylesheets you have the more you, the developer, have to
remember and keep track of. Where did you set the padding on that
element? It could be in a number of places and if you're not used to your
system, or you're not consistent with it, things can get frustrating. Set
yourself some guidelines and stick to them to give yourself a fighting
chance of taking an educated guess at where you might have placed your
rules. Consider putting these guidelines in comments at the top of your
files &ndash; these can help to keep you on topic while you're coding as
well as setting you off running when you come to make maintenance changes
months down the line. Something as simple as sensible naming conventions
for your CSS files can be a great help.</p>

	<p>EXSLT is an extension kit for XSL. A collection of templates that can be used within an XSL transformation to perform mathematic operation, string manipulations or working with reg-exp.</p>

	<p>Quite a powerful toolkit for any skilled XSL coder.<br />
The templates just get included into the XSL, their namespaces get declared and then the functions and templates are available for use like normal XSL functions.</p>

	<p>EXSLT also contains a couple of functions that emulate XSL functions only availble for newer parsers, such as string-tokenize.</p>

	<p>More information and package downloads available at <a href="http://www.exslt.org">exslt.org</a>.</p>

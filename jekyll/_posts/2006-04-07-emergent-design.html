	<p>Pascal mentioned it in his <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Blog/89/php-unit-testing-tutorial/">Unit testing tutorial post</a> but emergent design has changed the way I see coding&#8230; I work with Marcus (<a href="http://www.lastcraft.com">lastcraft</a>) and he&#8217;s had his work cut out for him converting me, but I&#8217;m now a born again test driven designer. I&#8217;ve also started to apply the same philosophy to loads of other things. I&#8217;m slowly moving over the the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/">Getting things Done</a> way of thinking and I let my designs evolve the same way. I&#8217;ve even started using a bulldog clip and index cards as a note pad&#8230;</p>

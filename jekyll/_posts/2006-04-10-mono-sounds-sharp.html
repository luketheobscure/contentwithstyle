	<p>If platform specifications change sometimes one has to make the descision if the app needs to be ported or if there is another way. My research about porting .Net applications reveals a surprisingly great range of Open Source tools.</p>

	<p>This starts with the IDE I am using for coding my C# application, the really well done <a href="http://www.sharpdevelop.com/OpenSource/SD/">SharpDevelop</a>  that after a while I find very easy to use.</p>

	<p>But for all the .Net newbies: Compiling a binary DLL in .Net doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s a windows dead end automatically. Especially for non-GUI applications (i.e. CLI or Web applications) it might work to just execute the DLL with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">mono</a>, <a href="http://www.apacheworld.org/modmono/">mod_mono</a> or <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.10.html">XSP</a>.</p>

	<p>At least it won&#8217;t be a big effort to port applications for mono most of the times, and since mono is so close to .Net there obviously is a mono port of SharpDevelop: <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/Main_Page">MonoDevelop</a>, which should run on most UNIX/Linux platforms (and MacOSX, even though I didn&#8217;t get my head around installing it properly), once all dependencies are installed.</p>

	<p>This road is not a one way track, either:<br />
For all those people who want to improve the performance of PHP scripts and don&#8217;t worry about using .Net or mono, the <a href="http://www.php-compiler.net/">Phalanger Compiler</a> might be the way to go.</p>

	<p>Jeremy Keith is giving another of his <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/services/training/ajax.php">Ajax training workshops</a>, this time up in Manchester. I was lucky enough to be in attendance for his London one and much fun was had by all. I really like Jeremy&#8217;s approach to the subject &#8211; it&#8217;s very much bottom-up, giving you a solid base from which to build in your own time. </p>

	<p>Predictably, he links Ajax-style coding to DOM scripting, under the catchy name of <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/41">Hijax</a>, which really appeals to my sense of style and best practice. My first shot at Ajax was my <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/38/fixing-the-back-button-and-enabling-bookmarking-for-ajax-apps/">Fixing the Back Button</a> article here on CwS and I used a similar approach. Now people are starting to ask about <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/03/13/notes-web-21-making-web-20-accessible/">accessibility in Web 2.0 apps</a> I&#8217;m expecting more and more people to start thinking this way.</p>

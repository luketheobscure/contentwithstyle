	<p>I meant to post about this a couple of weeks ago but I completely forgot&#8230; I hope I&#8217;m not too late. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=css_framework_design_contest_only">design competition</a> going on over at Raible Designs for AppFuse templates. Why do I care? They are using the CwS <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/17/a-css-framework/">CSS Framework</a> as the base. I&#8217;m chuffed that people are using it and excited to see what people can come up with!</p>

	<p>There&#8217;re some nice prizes in the offing for the winners: an iPod (60GB), an iPod (30GB) and a 2GB Nano.</p>

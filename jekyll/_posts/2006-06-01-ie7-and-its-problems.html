    <p>As Mike was busy doing this already on his blog <a href="http://www.donotremove.co.uk/weblog/fixing-donotremove-for-ie7/">donotremove.com</a> I quickly debugged our site for the public IE7 beta 2 that came out today.
    
    Like Mike pointed out correctly, most problems are gone once you updated the clearfix hack for IE7.</p>

    <div class="comment-text">Yeah, it&#8217;s really not all that bad is it? It&#8217;s a hassle but not the killer many people were expecting. I&#8217;m not a big fan of conditional comments because they separate my rules but I can live with &#8216;em&#8230;</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Sander: That doesn&#8217;t make any difference, does it? Apart from the pre-asumption that IE 8 fixes behaviour that still is unsupported or faulty in IE, i.e. :after<br />
    But even then, zoom:1 will not hurt and just be ignored, no? If you target IE7 only there is the chance that it breaks with version 8. But then again we&#8217;ll have to revise loads of code when 8 comes out anyway &#8230;</div>

    <div class="comment-text">I wouldn&#8217;t use gte IE6, but probably target IE7 directly with if IE 7.<br />
    <br />
    This way you won&#8217;t have to update your site again when the next version comes along as it may partly fix the issues your CCing for.</div>

	<p>As Mike was busy doing this already on his blog <a href="http://www.donotremove.co.uk/weblog/fixing-donotremove-for-ie7/">donotremove.com</a> I quickly debugged our site for the public IE7 beta 2 that came out today.</p>

	<p>Like Mike pointed out correctly, most problems are gone once you updated the <a href="http://positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html">clearfix hack</a> for IE7.</p>

	<p>This is done by creating a file that contains</p>

<pre>
.clearfix
{
    zoom: 1;
}
</pre>

	<p>and include it with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">conditional comments for IE</a></p>

<pre>
&lt;!--[if gte IE 6]&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" 
href="../css/ie_standard.css" /&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</pre>

	<p>I spent about 45 minutes to walk through a couple of old project websites and this pretty much always did the trick. The only exceptions I came accross were when the <a href="http://www.info.com.ph/~etan/w3pantheon/style/starhtmlbug.html">star html bug</a> was used to filter out IE, i.e. on this website the backgrouds for the rounded corners did not get loaded, and I had to add in a couple of lines to tackle this behaviour.</p>

	<p>So for the future I would recommend to use conditional comments straight away where possible.</p>

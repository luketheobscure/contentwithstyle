	<p>This is an extension to javascript that will be compiled into javascript afterwards, and helps you to write readable code by introducing the &#8220;blocking&#8221; operator (notated as &#8217;->&#8217;).</p>

	<p>It turns out that the blocking operator gets translated into javascript that heavily uses so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_passing_style">continuation passing style</a>. This principle allows you to keep the context of callbacks by gathering the context data and writing the exectution into a callstack.</p>

	<p>Quite an interesting concept that is and for sure the only compiled javascript aplication I ever heard of. Definitely will have a deeper look at this soon.</p>

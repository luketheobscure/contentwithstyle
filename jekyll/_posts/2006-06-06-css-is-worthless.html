<p>CSS does not make a site accessible. CSS does not make your site rank higher in search engines. 
Good CSS does not make you an elite web programmer. I don't code CSS. CSS is misunderstood.</p>

<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>I was looking at the HTML source of a website the other day and something a creative director 
once said to me popped into my head:</p>

<p><q>I really like this site. It's a really interesting design and it's done with CSS so 
it's accessible.</q></p>

<p>Wrong wrong wrong. CSS does not an accessible site make.</p>

<h2>The forgotten basics of CSS</h2>
<p>Let me quickly recap what cascading style sheets actually do... They allow you to redefine 
the presentation of any HTML tag. This means that there is no need to be bound by how a tag displays 
by default because you can change it. We can now use whatever markup makes sense and then redefine 
it to fit our design. That's the key benefit of CSS – it lets you use the right HTML.</p>

<h2>CSS is misunderstood</h2>
<p>This is the biggest misunderstanding that I come across when trying to teach someone CSS: 
They've heard that CSS is <em>the thing</em>; it's the way web pages should be done these days. It 
lets you do away with spacer gifs, achieve pixel perfect precision and carries accessibility and SEO 
benefits to boot. They want to learn CSS. I have a really hard time hammering home that CSS is only 
the icing and the real benefit comes from how they do the rest of their coding... And I suspect that 
an awful lot of people who say they can 'do' CSS have the same problem. </p>

<p>While consulting at a company a couple of weeks ago I was chatting to one of their developers, 
trying to gauge his level with web standards, and he told me that he could do CSS1 but not CSS2. What 
does that mean? I also see 'CSS2' as a requirement in a lot of job ads these days, as though knowledge of 
these extra properties somehow makes for a more accomplished web developer. I do not see any distinction 
(other than the obvious historical one) between CSS1 and 2 - I code my HTML properly and then use whatever 
rules come to hand the redefine the behaviour of those tags to fit into the required design. </p>

<p>A given site may not use a 
single property from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">CSS2 spec</a> but if the HTML is good it will have 
all the benefits people associate with CSS.</p>

<h2>HTML matters</h2>
<p>Now, at the beginning of this article I said that I don't code CSS. That's not entirely true but 
let me finish that sentence. I don't code CSS, I code semantic HTML. I happen to use CSS to restyle that 
HTML, to make it look the way I want, but that's an aside. <strong>I only use CSS because I use semantic HTML</strong>. I 
use HTML tags for their <em>appropriateness for the information they contain</em> (instead of for how they look) so I have to 
<em>redefine</em> how they behave.</p>

<p>Almost all of the benefits people normally attribute to CSS are actually down to the underlying (X)HTML. 
The better your markup, the better sense machines will be able to make of it – that includes both screenreaders 
and search engine spiders. </p>

<p>A bit of care and attention to what your page's markup actually means will go a long way. I'm not saying 
that everyone should agonise over whether to use a definition list or an unordered list for navigation – pedantry aside, either 
will do pretty well, but it pays to think about the content you are wrapping up. Do the headers go 
sequentially from <code>h1</code> down? Are your lists in <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code> and <code>dl</code>s? Are you using 
<code>div</code> elements unnecessarily? Is there 
something more meaningful you could use instead? I get the bulk of my HTML done before I touch the CSS – if it 
makes sense <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/naked-day/">naked</a> then I'm on the right track.</p>

<h2>Turning it around</h2>
<p>HTML can make a site accessible. HTML can make your site rank higher in search engines. Good HTML can make 
you an elite web programmer. HTML is misunderstood.</p>

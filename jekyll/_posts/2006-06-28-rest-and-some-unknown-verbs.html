    <div class="comment-text">While most browsers and server plateforms supports the 4 HTTP verbs, it is not always easy to find good information on how to use them. <br />
    <br />
    For instance, PHP assumes that a POST always contains form data  ($_POST is an associative array of field name/value pairs). If you want to POST something that is not a a form (a XML document for instance), you&#8217;ll have to resort to the rather obscure file_get_contents(&#8216;php://input&#8217;)  to get the raw data from the POST request.<br />
    <br />
    Also, you may want to take a look at Freja ( http://www.csscripting.com/Freja ) &#8211; Framework for REstful Javascript Applications.<br />
    <br />
    Applications built on Freja:<br />
    1. Run in the browser. <br />
    2. Use XML for data and DOM for data manipulation.<br />
    3. Use XSL for interface templates and client-side XSLT for interface rendering.<br />
    4. Are server-side agnostic. They communicate with RESTful web services using asynchronous HTTP requests.  PUT and DELETE verbs are supported since version 2.0<br />
    <br />
    Freja is not a server-side framework but there are a couple sample server-side scripts that show how to build PHP RESTful web services</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Pretty interesting read that &#8220;How I explained REST to my wife&#8221;. It reminds me of the Atom Publishing Protocol which is currently a draft at the IETF  which is using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE everywhere in order to manage ressources. It&#8217;s true that these verbs aren&#8217;t used as much as they should, and that&#8217;s probably because everyone has been busy working within the limitations of the browser. You can&#8217;t PUT, or DELETE from a browser.</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Unfortunately, too many web &#8220;experts&#8221; are oblivious to the less common REST methods. I&#8217;ve been using them for years, and ensure all my apps are coded in a REST-ful way.<br />
    <br />
    Seems as though its made my life <em>much</em> easier, as I don&#8217;t think about the same problems as most people when developing.<br />
    <br />
    One thing to remember about the difference between PUT and POST &#8211; PUT does exactly what it says on the tin &#8211; it is supposed to PUT a resource onto the server/target. Simple.<br />
    <br />
    POST, however, has become confused. Essentially, it is meant to POST an update to the server, updating a specific resource, a list, or database. Its meant as a catch-all when one of the other methods won&#8217;t do. <br />
    <br />
    So, to PUT something, you&#8217;d use &lt;form method=&#8221;put&#8221; action=&#8221;/path/to/resource/dir/&#8221;&gt;... whereas POST would point to the resource to be updated: &lt;form method=&#8221;post&#8221; action=&#8221;/path/to/resource.ext&#8221;&gt;<br />
    <br />
    However, just like GET, it has become misused by the web community at large. Just like some developers use GET to post updated information to a server (causing a whole host of problems with web &#8220;caching&#8221; software &#8211; see google cache), they use POST to put a new resource online.<br />
    <br />
    Lets hope this practice is forgotten sooner rather than later.<br />
    <br />
    One of the more useful methods of REST is HEAD, where you can get information about a resource without actually GETting the resource. This is useful in confirming updates/changes to a file made from another source or finding out whether a resource exists before updating it.<br />
    <br />
    A really useful resource is the HTTP/1.1 spec:<br />
    http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616<br />
    This gives you information on all the HTTP methods, plus all the response codes that can be issued/expected from the server.<br />
    <br />
    If you&#8217;re interested, refactored is a RESTful framework I&#8217;m developing which has a few additional features not seen in most frameworks&#8230; keep your eye out for its first release!</div>

    <div class="comment-text">I had no idea about PUT or DELETE! Never heard of them and never used them&#8230; Since I don&#8217;t do much server side development I shouldn&#8217;t be all that surprised that I&#8217;ve not used them but, like Pascal, I can&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;ve never even heard of them!</div>

    Actually, some Browsers do support PUT and DELETE as well, at least using javascript&#8217;s xmlhttprequest. As far as I know are Mozilla based browsers and IE perfectly fine with it. Not sure about Opera, but I know that Safari doesn&#8217;t like it.<br />
    <br />
    Also, php&#8217;s php://input will happily accept any sent information in POST as well as PUT and DELETE. I&#8217;m sure HEAD is fine, too.</div>

	<p>I started off with a little <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=REST+urls&#38;hl=en&#38;hs=BW1&#38;lr=&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;start=10&#38;sa=N">google search</a> and had a read about <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html">Building Web Services the REST Way</a> which made clear to me that you could POST something to its already given URL as a natural way of updating ressources.</p>

	<p>A bit further down the list there was a very interesting article called <a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">How I explained REST to my wife&#8230;</a> that initially came across a bit stupid, but then in the end flagged up some very true points about the benefits that HTTP and REST has, mentioning GET, POST and PUT &#8230; </p>

	<p>Hang on, PUT? What the heck is that? Yet another google search and I knew a bit more:</p>

	<blockquote cite="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put"><p>The &#8220;PUT&#8221; method is similar to the POST method in that it can cause information to be updated on the server. The difference is that the POST method is normally handed a script which is explicitly named by the resource (that is, something that already exists), while a PUT request could be directed at a resource which does not (yet) exist. Another difference is that the POST method can be used in response to a form, while the PUT method can only contain a single data item. The PUT method is suited for publishing pages.</p></blockquote>

	<p>Seems like I discovered a verb that was unknown to me up to this point. Same was DELETE as http method mentioned in this article.<br />
Time to look up the whole family I thought, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">according to the w3c</a> you have even more methods.<br />
Also there is a <a href="http://perso.ec-lyon.fr/lyonel.vincent/apache/mod_put.html">mod_put</a> for apache utilizing the PUT and DELETE method.</p>

	<p>Amazingly I never came accross them, and that is in 5 years+ of proramming web applications. Am I the only guy missing out on these basic HTTP definitions?</p>

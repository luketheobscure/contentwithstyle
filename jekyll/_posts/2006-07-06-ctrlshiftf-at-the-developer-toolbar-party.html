    <div class="comment-text">Nice find! I knew there was such a function but I didn&#8217;t know the shortcut. As I have a soft spot for shortcuts I find this feature rather nice!<br />

    Cheers!</div>

    I just figured out why I never came across this: On the web developer toolbar 0.9.4 which I had installed, there is no such thing; I can only assume that it was added when Firefox 1.5 came out and I never bothered taking a fresh look at new features.</div>

    <div class="comment-text">The first thought that came to my mind when I was in bloglines is, &#8220;what on earth could I not know about THE webdev toolbar?&#8221; and to my suprise I was totally shocked. I had never seen that before and it is so handy. Thanks for the goodness.<br />

    BTW: You might want to check the taborder on your comment form. It&#8217;s kindda annoying to pop up to the home link insetead of the preview button.</div>

    i used that toolbar every day, and really like the idea of the shortcut, has anyone else had problems with it not actually working?</div>

    <div class="comment-text">The most useful part of the CTRL+SHIFT+F for me is the <em>exact</em> font size that&#8217;s being rendered in pix on firefox &#8211; useful if you&#8217;re using relative font sizes, and can&#8217;t work out the maths, and want better than &#8216;looks about right&#8217;.<br />
    <br />
    I find doing a quick print screen and semi-transparently overlaying in your photoshop or fireworks design is the best way, which begs another question &#8211; should you be going to the spec (e.g. 10px arial 130% leading) or to what comes out looking best?</div>

    <div class="comment-text"><p>Problem - the ctrl+shift+f button is now a set-part of Firefox with the new release of version 3.6. When the shortcut is hit, it now changes the view of the Firefox screen to a full-screen display (I\'m assuming F stands for full-screen). So this part is no longer available... unless there is a way to change the shortcuts, or if there\'s a newer version by Chris (plugin author) that changes the shortcut set for this. </p></div>

	<p>This is my find of the day:<br />
Hit Ctrl + Shift + F when using <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Chris Pederick&#8217;s developer toolbar</a>, or &#8220;display element information&#8221; under Information. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m so late to this party, that the only ones left are some crying girl with an empty bottle of spirits and a sad sausage swimming in lukewarm water.</p>

	<p><img src="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/resources/old_images/20.gif" alt="" width="405" height="280" /></p>

	<p>Now more seriously: You&#8217;ll find a nice summary including attributes, ancestors and children as well as position and style information for every element you roll over. </p>

	<p>Of course you can get similar results (depending on what you&#8217;re after) with with CSS->View style information, Outline block elements or by using <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/">Firebug&#8217;s</a> inspector; but it doesn&#8217;t claim as much space, and the information is presented very nicely.</p>

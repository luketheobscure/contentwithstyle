	<p>This is my find of the day:<br />
Hit Ctrl + Shift + F when using <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Chris Pederick&#8217;s developer toolbar</a>, or &#8220;display element information&#8221; under Information. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m so late to this party, that the only ones left are some crying girl with an empty bottle of spirits and a sad sausage swimming in lukewarm water.</p>

	<p>Now more seriously: You&#8217;ll find a nice summary including attributes, ancestors and children as well as position and style information for every element you roll over. </p>

	<p>Of course you can get similar results (depending on what you&#8217;re after) with with CSS->View style information, Outline block elements or by using <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/">Firebug&#8217;s</a> inspector; but it doesn&#8217;t claim as much space, and the information is presented very nicely.</p>

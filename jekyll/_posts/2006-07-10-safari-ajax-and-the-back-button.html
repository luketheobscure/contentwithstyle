	<p>A while ago David Bloom posted a <a href="http://bloomd.home.mchsi.com/histapi/test.html"  title="and others">back button, bookmarking and so on fix for Safari</a>, which, aside from some funny character garbage at the end, works reliably enough to be used for all your Ajax and Flash needs.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve got the feeling that one reason it didn&#8217;t get its deserved attention is that he called it &#8220;Fragment identifier history&#8221;, which might be the right terminology, but doesn&#8217;t help much in the publicity department.</p>

	<p>I didn&#8217;t post this before, as I wanted to compare and integrate his solution with <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/38/fixing-the-back-button-and-enabling-bookmarking-for-ajax-apps/">Mike&#8217;s approach</a> and the <a href="http://www.blog.lessrain.com/index.php?s=back+button">work of others</a>. But time is of the essence and I didn&#8217;t have any so far, not even for the <a href="http://www.blog.lessrain.com/?p=357">solution we currently use at Less Rain</a>. This one fixes IE by using a client-side VB script, how weird is that?</p>

	<p>So, I wonder, has anyone seen a solution that is publicly available, documented and works on Safari and possibly Opera as well? Or is it just not fashionable any more to incorporate this kind of solution?</p>

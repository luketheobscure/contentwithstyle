<p>
Using XSL transformations in .Net I came accross the weird behaviour that my transformations would be UTF-16 encoded even though I specified UTF-8 in the <code>&lt;xsl:output /&gt;</code> tag.
</p>

<p>
This left me a bit speechless, and I was assuming that this only could be a .Net bug. After a bit of research, however, I found this to be a result of .Net being very specific about character encodings.
</p>

<p>
In my following example the StringWriter has the property Encoding set to System.Text.Encoding.UTF-16, hence the output charset will be UFT-16 as well, no matter what I specify as character set in the XSL.
</p>

<pre><code>
XslTransform xslt = new XslTransform();
StringWriter output = new StringWriter();
xslt.Transform(xml, args, output);
String code_transformed = output.ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>
<a href="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/41/205082.aspx">Steven Livingstone pointed out</a> that, since the encoding property of System.IO.StringWriter is a read only property, one has to provide a different Stream object to recieve the transformation output, if this is to be encoded in UTF-8:
</p>

<pre><code>
XslTransform xslt = new XslTransform();
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
xslt.Transform(xml, args, ms);
ms.Position = 0;
StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(ms, Encoding.UTF8);
String code_transformed = sr.ReadToEnd();
</code></pre>

<p>
Another possibility would be to extend the StringWriter class in order to make a different encoding possible, as suggested on Robert McLaws <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2003/07/31/22080.aspx">FunWithCoding.Net</a> which would read as follows:
</p>

<pre><code>
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;

namespace MyAwesomeNamespace
{
  public class StringWriterWithEncoding : StringWriter
  {
    private Encoding _enc;

    public StringWriterWithEncoding(Encoding NewEncoding) : base()
    {
      _enc = NewEncoding;
    }

    public override System.Text.Encoding Encoding
    {
      get
      {
         return _enc;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

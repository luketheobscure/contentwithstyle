    <div class="comment-text">This is why the bliki I&#8217;m coding for myself won&#8217;t have any comments.

    <div class="comment-text">You should try BadBehavior. It blocks Spam for sure by analyzing the headers, not the content. Works for me and blocks 100 percent of the crap out there.</div>

	<p>Sadly we lately have to deal with unpleasant things. One is the comment spam, that actually is getting worse and worse. But since Mike did write his latest article with a bit of a tabloid title we have to deal with some other things as well &#8230;</p>

	<p>Which are insults. A bit disappointing for me, really, since I invest spare time and money in this project without asking for anything in return. I think that we already successfully sparked some interesting discussions with our articles, and to drop a line like &#8220;You are loosers&#8221; or something similar just doesn&#8217;t do us right I think.</p>

	<p>Please note that we moderate the comments. Every single one will be reviewed, and no insult or spam be switched visible. The same goes for really off-topic comments, that we will answer in an email though.</p>

	<p>So much for our comments and our problems with them. </p>

	<p>On the other side of things we had nearly 30.000 unique visitors a month, our traffic (and that is text data mostly) ate up about 4.84 Gigabytes. A massive 284604 page impressions have been logged and all together that adds up to more than 900000 hits.</p>

	<p>That is a big success for us and we are happy that the site is well percieved. Hopefully we will come up with some more articles in the near future, but again a quick reminder: This website is done in our spare time, and we can only write when we have spare time.</p>

	<p>If you think you have an idea for an article then feel free to send us a draft. We would welcome more writing on here.</p>

    <p>Should we all strive to have a more general knowledge in our field of work?</p>

	<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.thefwa.com/articles/flashdevs0906.html">article</a> by <a href="http://www.velloff.com/">Nick Velloff</a>. (via <a href="http://blog.lessrain.com/">lessrain blog</a>)</p>

	<p>We just discussed this a little bit in the office, with different opinions. I think there&#8217;s a flaw in the article, as to me it reads that the hybrid flash developer is the way to go. I wonder: Has a hybrid developer, or a &#8220;generalist&#8221; as some people call it, ever been out of fashion? Will it lose eventually against the &#8220;specialist&#8221;?</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t believe in that. The essence I take out of this article is in this sentence:</p>

	<p><cite>This developer generally has an excellent rapport and mutual level of respect with designers.</cite></p>

	<p>But it really doesn&#8217;t read as if the article focusses on this point. Further down Nick starts a list with ideas of how to make yourself be more design-aware. Wow: &#8220;Pay attention to design comps&#8221; and &#8220;Try and be creative&#8221;. Is he serious?</p>

	<p>Sure, when I &#8220;Try to sit near the designers&#8221;, I&#8217;m really after an exchange, and that helps understanding each other. Understanding how the other one thinks, what excites them and what makes them tick. Nick is after the right result, but his viewpoint is confusing me.</p>

	<p>In small creative agencies you&#8217;ll always need hybrid developers of any kind; there&#8217;s different possibilities, e.g. one person that designs and animates, another one that does the heavy actionscript coding; or one designer that creates templates down to html and css, and a programmer that breathes life into the templates. Or the other way round: I myself am responsible for front and back-end coding, HTML and PHP mostly, and I mostly treat it as 2 jobs. There&#8217;s many possibilities, and small companies rely on them. <br />
Bigger companies will look for very specialized employees, so that one only does the job they&#8217;re best at.<br />
But what stays is the need for mutual respect, the rough understanding of the person doing their job before or after you. Or their job, rather. Preparing your work so that they have an easier life once they start their task.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t make the hybrid developer better or worse than one specializing in one or the other field. So a call to push yourself to become a hybrid developer is essentially only for folks that want to work in a small team. The respect for your teammates is something you can utilise anywhere you work. </p>

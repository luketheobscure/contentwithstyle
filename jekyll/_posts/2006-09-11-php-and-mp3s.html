	<p>While setting up a media server for the <a href="http://www.netaudiolondon.cc">Netaudio Festival</a> next weekend I had not only to set up a dedicated machine with samba shares, Webserver and Web based interface, but also to play around with mp3s and ID3 tags.</p>

	<p>First I wanted to use the <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package-info.php?package=id3&#38;version=0.2">id3 package</a> . But after getting errors using the PEAR installer (phpize first was missing, then still failed when reading the package) I eventually gave up and went with the fantastic <a href="http://getid3.sourceforge.net/">GetID3</a> script.<br />
Very cool, especially because the MySQL Demo already features a full data structure and recursive indexing of directories.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll keep you updated on this one as I want to make the script I wrote Open Source for everyone to enjoy, but it needs a bit of tidying up.</p>

    <p>Working with PHP5 and the built-in XSLT processor I came accross the method <a href="http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/function.xsl-xsltprocessor-register-php-functions.php">registerPHPFunctions</a> that lets you register PHP functions in XSL. Quite a neat feature. Wonder how much that slows the transformation down?</p>

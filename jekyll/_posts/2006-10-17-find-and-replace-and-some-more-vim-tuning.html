	<p>Awkward at first glance <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> has become my editor of choice. A modified .vimrc file based on the one found at <a href="http://schlitt.info/applications/blog/index.php?/archives/331-Comfortable-PHP-editing-with-VIM-3.html">schlitt.info</a><br />
enables quite a couple of extras that make work fast and efficient.</p>

	<p>Handy as well is the functionality to add comments, again, found at <a href="http://schlitt.info/applications/blog/index.php?/archives/488-Comfortable-PHP-editing-with-VIM-5.html">schlitt.info</a> and available for download at <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1355">vim.org</a></p>

	<p>Neat: <a href="http://www.vim.org/tips/tip.php?tip_id=31">Search and Replace in VIM</a> works by utilizing the <a href="http://www.cornerstonemag.com/sed/">sed</a> stream editor.</p>

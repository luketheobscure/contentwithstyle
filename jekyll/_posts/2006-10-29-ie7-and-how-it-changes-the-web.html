    <div class="comment-text">The only regret I have no after a couple of months in the &#8220;IE7 universe&#8221; is that they didn&#8217;t break MORE sites&#8230;!<br />
    IE6 posed some MASSIVE &#8220;anti standards&#8221; issues on Web Developers and I think they should have gone even FURTHER of breaking those sites to force users into the arms of w3c&#8230; ;)</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Not only does it revitalize the web industry but it also cuts away alot of &#8220;baggage&#8221; in the sense that all those crappy &#8220;IE6 Active X&#8221; developers and &#8220;Well it works in IE so I don&#8217;t care about industry standards&#8221; people will be out of work :)<br />

	<p>Simon Griffin from <a href="http://www.etre.com/">etre</a> sent us a rather interesting email about some research they&#8217;ve done on IE7 &#8230;</p>

	<p>Hi,</p>

	<p>I was just browsing your site and thought you might be interested in a study we just published.</p>

	<p>As I&#8217;m sure you know, prior to its release last week, many were predicting that Internet Explorer 7.0 would break the internet. Indeed, Microsoft itself admitted that certain sites that worked well in IE6 would fall apart in IE7. Unfortunately, no one seemed to know exactly how many sites would be affected by the launch of the new browser. So to get an idea, we decided to fire up a couple of machines and compare the homepages of a hundred different corporate websites in both IE6 and IE7. The results are available on our blog at: <a href="http://www.etre.com/blog/2006/10/ie7_were_they_ready/">http://www.etre.com/blog/2006/10/ie7_were_they_ready/</a> </p>

	<p>If our findings are indicative of websites in general (which I admit requires a bit of a leap of faith!), they would suggest that around 12.7 million websites in need of a little TLC as a result of the introduction of IE7!</p>

	<p>Anyway, hope this is of interest to you.</p>

	<p>Kind regards,</p>

	<p>Thanks Simon for that info.<br />
I am actually quite pleased to hear this. Turns out to be a great source of revenue for the web industries. <br />
From a bit of a sarcastic point of view: It often seems to be a good excuse for doing a complete relaunch of the whole content management system and everything else, when the logo&#8217;s not in place anymore. Not that the other bad aspects weren&#8217;t urgent, but this one&#8217;s unbearable &#8230;</p>

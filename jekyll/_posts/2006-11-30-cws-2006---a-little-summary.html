	<p>With 2006 nearly over it&#8217;s time for a little look back on what happened with CwS throughout the year.</p>

	<p><strong>2006 came with some major difficulties and changes for us.</strong></p>

	<p>We were offline for ages, being kicked out of our shared hosting platform and <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Blog/85/offtime-moving-and-some-changes/">had to sort out some hosting solution</a> that wouldn&#8217;t cause the same trouble again.</p>

	<p>A bit on the negative side as well is our article output, which is just two articles throughout the whole year.</p>

	<p>We had a <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Blog/107/spam-and-some-other-things-/">mad increase of spam being dropped in our comments</a>, and a couple of insults came up as well. </p>

	<p>Plus, we got rid of the Events section because we realized it was to much to manage in a way that wouldn&#8217;t come across as half-hearted.</p>

	<p><strong>On the other hand it wasn&#8217;t all just negative.</strong></p>

	<p>We did successfully introduce the <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Blog/">Blog section</a>, where we published quite a lot of things, from general things to little code snippets, and sparked some interesting discussions as well.</p>

	<p>We received quite a lot of attention, i.e. Mike being asked to predict the future in .Net magazine.</p>

	<p>Our stats look good, really. With around 20k unique visitors each month and something like 3 million page impressions throughout this year we&#8217;re quite pleased to have that many readers.</p>

	<p>And last but not least, some people dropped some nice comments and made us feel like we contributed something.</p>

	<p><strong>As a little outlook for 2007</strong> I cannot really offer anything more than some of the things we&#8217;d fancy to do, if we ever find the time to tackle them:</p>

	<p><em>We&#8217;d like to do a redesign and relaunch</em><br />
<em>We&#8217;d like to write some proper articles</em><br />
<em>We&#8217;d like to have others writing some articles for us</em></p>

	<p><strong>So there&#8217;s just one more thing to do then:</strong><br />
We wish you a great rest of 2006 and a good start into 2007. Enjoy the holidays and a happy new year, or, as the Germans say &#8220;Frohe Weihnachten und einen guten Rutsch&#8221;!</p>

    <div class="comment-text">Ber, first of all thank you for bringing this up. I can see why you are concerned, even though I don&#8217;t think you have a point here. Let me explain to you why:<br />
    <br />
    By default register_globals is off, and I always have turned it off. Which means that $query in the example above cannot refer to the equivalent of $_GET[&#8216;query&#8217;].<br />
    <br />
    That means that $query is just any variable. SURELY IT SHOULD BE ESCAPED FIRST! But you cannot really tell if that hasn&#8217;t happened by just looking at the example above. <br />
    <br />
    If you were thinking that this refers to a GET variable because you are still working with register_globals turned on, then I strongly advise you to not do so anymore, because that would mean a major security hole.</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Extremely! Insecure! <br />
    Never! Ever! pass in $query just like that. Its the #1 security hole in most systems. It is called SQL injection.</div>

	<p>Via JV Multimedia:</p>

	<p>A quick and neat way to use MySQL fulltext search with weighted relevance modificators.</p>

<pre><code>

SELECT
*,
(MATCH (category) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE)*100) +
(MATCH (title) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE)*10) +
MATCH (body) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS rating
FROM
stories
WHERE
MATCH (title,category,body) AGAINST ('$query' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
ORDER BY
rating DESC
LIMIT 0,10

</code></pre>

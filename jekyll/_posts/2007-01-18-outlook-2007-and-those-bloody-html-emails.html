	<p>Microsoft comes up with a great way of rendering emails in Outlook 2007 which might cause Matthias to refuse doing any HTML formatted emails in the future. </p>

	<p>David Greiner posted this interesting article on <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html">campaignmonitor.com</a><br />
stating that Microsoft just threw back the development of HTML emails for about 5 years, and even though <a href="http://www.molly.com/2007/01/18/what-happened-with-html-and-css-in-outlook-2007/">Molly Holzschlag</a> seems to be more pragmatic about the whole thing than David, saying that we should dry our tears and start dealing with the problem, the problem itself remains:</p>

	<p>It will not be possible to use accessible, standard-compliant and best-practice HTML to format emails anymore.<br />
Outlook 2007 will mess everything up and cripple anything that uses floats and other sophisticated CSS commands.</p>

	<p>While many people get really worked up over this I start secretly smiling and telling myself my honest opinion over and over again:<br />
&#8220;There shouldn&#8217;t be ANY HTML in emails. They&#8217;re supposed to be plain text and maybe some attachments!&#8221; </p>

    Apparently most of the people using Photoshop on Linux do not use the Save For Web feature. I couldn&#8217;t find mention of this problem anywhere. Everything else works so I wonder what the deal is?<br />
    <br />
    Without this plugin, I pretty much have no use for Photoshop. The GIMP does everything else (for the most part).</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Using Gimp on Linux is much better than having to rely on Wine thing which was extremely buggy on my installation of Ubuntu. 
    
    There is a tweaked Gimp which has been adapted to look and feel like PhotoShop and contains the Save For Web feature also. 
    
    A general point on Gimp is that it is a pretty darn powerful image editor and worth spending some time with if you are working on Linux all the time. </div>

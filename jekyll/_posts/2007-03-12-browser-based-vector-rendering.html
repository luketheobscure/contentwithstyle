	<p>Today <a href="http://www.redwiredesign.com/profile/justin_finkelstein.html">Justin</a> came across a demo for the <a href="http://ajax3d.sourceforge.net/">Ajax3d engine</a>, an entirely JavaScript based 3d engine that utilizes the canvas tag for rendering vector based graphics.</p>

	<p>Canvas tag? A little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_%28HTML_element%29">research</a> reveals that this is yet another proprietary tag, this time introduced by Apple.<br />
With all of us in the office Browsing the web a bit more, <a href="http://www.redwiredesign.com/profile/tom_westcott.html">Tom</a> finds a <a href="http://testzone.danieljmarra.com/canvas/canvaspong/">pong game</a> and various other stuff on the web, all done using the canvas tag.</p>

	<p>One big downside, though: It is not supported in IE!</p>

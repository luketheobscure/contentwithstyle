    <div class="comment-text">Ah. Well, things are still in development, and I can&#8217;t really show you the ones this is all about; but I could rustle up a demo that does the same thing, together with the xsl-fo. Yes, that would be nice of me. I&#8217;ll fix something up tomorrow.</div>

	<p>A lot of 3-letter abbrevations here, I wanted to share some notes about this.<br />
So, the scenario I was faced with was to create a pdf with some dynamic content (text, pixel-based image). As usual, nobody wants to spend any money and the &#8220;open-source&#8221; card is played early.<br />
So, after a short look I find <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/index.html">FOP</a>, an apache project that renders pdf and other formats out of a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xslfo/default.asp">XSL-FO</a> source.<br />
XSL-FO is an XML subset, that allows you to mark up content in order to generate print formats, such as pdf, rtf or postscript.</p>

	<p>My trouble started when I had to embed a font, as pdf only comes with <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.20.5/fonts.html#Base-14+Fonts">a small preconfigured set</a> :<br />
<cite>The Adobe PDF Specification specifies a set of 14 fonts that must be available to every PDF reader: Helvetica (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Times (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Courier (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Symbol and ZapfDingbats.</cite></p>

	<p>For FOP you could create a metrics file needed to embed a font with an accompanying tool. On OS X I discovered that Preview did not display the text using the font. Luckily that was fixed quickly when I tried out the <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.93/fonts.html#truetype-metrics">-enc ansi</a> option. I&#8217;m not sure why there are 2 ways to create a metrics file, but hey, the ansi version works with Preview, the default one (CID-keyed) doesn&#8217;t.<br />
Everything seemed fine.</p>

	<p>Until I realised that this version only creates 72dpi output, regardless what you specify. Not great when the pdf is meant to be printed out.<br />
So I went for the most recent release, <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.93/index.html">fop 0.93</a>. While I could now generate 150dpi output (or any kind of resolution, for that matter), it didn&#8217;t recognize my previously generated metrics file, or font, and gave me grief with some warnings similar to this:</p>

<pre>
SEVERE: Failed to read font metrics file null
java.io.EOFException: Reached EOF, file size=5104 offset=5104
</pre>

	<p>After some international swearing, a lunch-break and some research I found <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/fop-users@xmlgraphics.apache.org/msg06266.html">this little gem</a> in their mailing list. It kinda reads as if they literally forgot to test with their own test fonts before release. But who am I to complain, I didn&#8217;t spend a minute developing it, did I? <br />
So, after downloading an <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&#38;revision=496860">updated font file reader</a> together with ant and the source package of the 0.93 release, I compiled the whole thing again, without any problems, and started rendering away happily.</p>

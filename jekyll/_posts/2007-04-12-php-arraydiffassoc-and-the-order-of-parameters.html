    Even worse: The manual says so!!!! Just that I was to stupid to read it.

This took a while till I found out: They actually do matter!

Even worse: The manual says so!!!! Just that I was to stupid to read it.

Lesson learned. No more guessing, no more quick reading!

<pre><code>
&lt;?
$a = array(
    'x' => 'x',
    'y' => 'y',
    'z' => 'z',
    't' => 't',
);

$b = array(
    'x' => 'x',
    'y' => 'y',
    'z' => 'z',
    't' => 't',
    'g' => 'g',
);

print_r(array_diff_assoc($a, $b));
print_r(array_diff_assoc($b, $a));
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
This will output:
</p>

<pre><code>
Array
(
)
Array
(
    [g] => g
)
</code></pre>

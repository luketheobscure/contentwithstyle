<p>
I was quite surprised to find out that the insertBefore method actually does most of the job for you.
<br />
A detail in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/core.html#ID-952280727">the manual</a> offers us insight in how: "If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed."
<br />
<br />
Hence:
</p>

<pre><code>
myNode.parentNode.insertBefore(myNode, myNode.nextSibling);
</code></pre>

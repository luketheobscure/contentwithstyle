    I&#8217;m not digging the green border there, and the lower right hand side is just about the least likely place that it will actually get clicked.<br />
    <br />
    I recommend on of those tiny ones right after your content and before your comments.<br />
    <br />
    I also recommend you use CrazyEgg to get a baseline of where people are already clicking and then experiment with layouts to see what gets the most clicks. (I&#8217;m one of the 2 CrazyEgg developers)</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Ads? What ads. Oh yeah, that&#8217; right. I&#8217;m running AdBlock as well. <br />
    <br />
    I&#8217;ve always wondered, how much money could a site like th is possibly make on ads? I just find it hard to believe that many people are going to voluntarily inerrupt their browsing and view some product or whatever. It is just so foreign to me. I&#8217;ve spent all my life trying to filter ads out (now nearly perfected with Adbock Plus). The last thing I&#8217;m going to do is CLICK on them. :-)<br />
    <br />
    Well, good luck with them anyway.</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Matthew, that&#8217;s all fair enough. We&#8217;re about to find out how much money that will generate, I suspect iot to be a very low amout, but maybe it covers the cost for the traffic, and then I&#8217;m sorted for this at least.<br />
    <br />
    I myself hardly ever click on ads, ad I think it&#8217;s up to everyone to make up their own minds. Some people might argue that, if noone ever clicked on ads, a lot of technical resources would be gone.
    <br />
    <br />
    As for myself, I am happy that people still browse the website rather than staring to scream &#8220;The layout is broken!&#8221;</div>

	<p>I kept trying to avoid them, but in the end of the day I cannot see why bandwidth gets burned up without any cost return. And everyone else does seem to do it.</p>

	<p>I hope your eyes are not massively insulted. If you have any better ideas then this, please let me know. </p>

	<p>Now we just need some new articles to go along with it, in order to really raise some money for the poor server monkeys of CwS!</p>

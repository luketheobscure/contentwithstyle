	<p>I don&#8217;t know how many of you guys out there are seriously testing their javascript applications, and how you do approach tesing them.<br />
I, until now, have been doing the good old step by step alert thing &#8230;</p>

	<p>But my recent reading and the changes in my PHP development, where I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> more and more, made me shop around for finding something similar for JavaScript.</p>

	<p>The one I want to start using from now on to debug my scripts and trace their output, is called <a href="http://jsassertunit.sourceforge.net/">jsassertunit</a></p>

	<p>A port of the xUnit framework (know from <a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">JUnit</a> or <a href="http://phpunit.sourceforge.net/">PHPUnit</a>) is <a href="http://www.jsunit.net/">JsUnit</a></p>

	<p>Browsing around on the general subject of unit testing, I even came accross a <a href="http://xsltunit.org/">test framework for XSLT</a>. That left me quite surprised, and I wonder how many people really do use things like this. But then again, XSLT is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">turing complete</a>, so you can do potentially anything computable with it.</p>

	<p>If anyone has suggestions or helpful examples on using unit tests in javascript, please drop a comment.<br />
Also, I&#8217;d like to ask you, dear reader, to comment about your general testing practice and approach to debugging, not only JavaScript but everything you code.</p>

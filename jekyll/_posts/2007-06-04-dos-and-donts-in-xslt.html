	<p>A nice little roundup of how to efficiently use XSLT can be found <a href="http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/academics/courses/is290-8/s04/lectures/5/dragons/allslides.html">here</a></p>

	<p>I came accross this link when reading about <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-06-10/Push_vs_pu">Push vs Pull XSL</a> , something thatw ill change my approach on XSL quite a lot. Reading up on modes, push vs pull and so on basically gave me one of these moments that you had when you realized that tables and the way you were using them where not really appropriate in HTML.</p>

	<p>Quite a <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/200102/msg01119.html">drastic quote</a>, but true if I consider how I did my XSL code until now, I can only say he&#8217;s right:</p>

	 <blockquote><p>
Whether your favorite conceptual module is pipes and filters, tuple spaces, or just good ol&#8217; lambdas, a fundamental understanding of push techniques is essential if you want to ever do any serious development in XSLT. New arrivals to this field take short-cuts only to get lost later. From a purely practical point of view, I think it&#8217;s important to teach apply-templates, modes and friends well before for-each, and bitchin&#8217; value-of tricks.

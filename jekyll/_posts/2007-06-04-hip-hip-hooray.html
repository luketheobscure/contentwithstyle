	<p>We did it. After more than one year we have a new article online.</p>

	<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/151/templates-from-babel/">Templates from Babel?</a> after being involved in the development of an XSL driven CMS for <a href="http://www.redwiredesign.com">Redwire</a> and then developing two small projects for <a href="http://www.sennep.com">Sennep</a> using the cakePHP framework.</p>

	<p>It is meant as a careful  critical remark rather than anything else, and any comments would on the article are most welcome.</p>

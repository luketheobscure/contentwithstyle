	<p>For a couple of years now I keep stressing the fact that line-height works best when you don&#8217;t provide a unit. And I am not saying this for no reason.</p>

	<p>As <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/">neatly explained by Eric Meyer</a> the unitless line height doesn&#8217;t enforce it&#8217;s computed size onto the inheriting element.</p>

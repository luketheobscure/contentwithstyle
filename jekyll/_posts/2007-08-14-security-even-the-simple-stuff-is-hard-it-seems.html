	<p>So I am reading about <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/08/ftp_files_expose_web_site_cred.html">the bug in IE that puts your FTP details into the comments plaintext</a> ...</p>

	<p>And I must say, it makes me chuckle. A while ago one of my friends sent a bulk mail to all of his contacts, containing an FTP link that he dragged from the address bar of IE into the mail in outlook. Needless to say that this contained username, password and host. </p>

	<p>A comment about maybe changing the password or so was shrugged off, and when I demonstrated how fast the index.html was changed into a page stating that one should think about security, he was asking me to change it back &#8230; but still couldn&#8217;t be bothered to change the password.</p>

	<p>What I want to say with this little story is, that even just the very concept of basic security measures doesn&#8217;t really touch the average folk. They are completely oblivious of the world around them being able to exploit private data or damaging their business.</p>

	<p>Even worse, that, on various occasions when asking for what kind of authentication I should implement and pointing out that the chosen one is really bad, I have been told off for &#8220;overcomplicating things&#8221; and there were ovious security issues in the final application that I wasn&#8217;t allowed to fix, because the client was not being expected to be able to remember a different password to his own username.</p>

	<p>I think it sometimes is a matter of responsibility for developers to protect people from themselves, making username/password combinations like myname/myname impossible, etc.</p>

    <div class="comment-text">For me it&#8217;s the opposite. IM is quote a useful tool in my daily work life, as it&#8217;s a good representation of what I call my &#8220;knowledge network&#8221;, people that I worked with and that I consult if I have questions. For me &#8220;developers community&#8221; has an actual meaning, and IM makes it possible.</div>

	<p>Since I&#8217;m a great fan of <a href="http://www.meebo.com">meebo</a> and consider it one of the best examples for an AJAX application, I am pretty thrilled to see the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5700">meebo Firefox extension</a> .</p>

	<p>It adds popup alerts, i.e. for incoming messages, and a neat sidebar that shows the contact list. Well done, meebo!</p>

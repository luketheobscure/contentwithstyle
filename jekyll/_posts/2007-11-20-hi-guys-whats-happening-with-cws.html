	<p>Good question! We were about to ask ourselves the same question.<br />
Even though Matthias came up with a <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/161/figure-microformats/">new article</a> today, we cannot deny that not much that has happened here in the past couple of months. We&#8217;re basically facing some descisions wether to leave CwS to die quietly, or to keep it alive &#8230; </p>

	<p>... and the bad news is: We&#8217;re all awfully busy at the moment. In fact we&#8217;re so busy, that with the way the site is set up currently, we&#8217;re sure we cannot make it a more lively place, as none of us really has the time to write full fledged articles. And since we didn&#8217;t even get around to set up a pagination yet, the Blog hasn&#8217;t really got the capacity to grow much more, either &#8230;</p>

	<p><strong>BUT:</strong></p>

	<p>We don&#8217;t want CwS to die like this. We&#8217;ve made up our minds, and we decided to invest some serious time into a brand new CwS, wich will happen somewhen in the beginning of 2008. We&#8217;re going to have a new design, we&#8217;ll migrate to a new platform, we&#8217;re going to focus on the blog more, with many more authors, still have the occasional article, we&#8217;re going to introduce a new categorizations, and we&#8217;re pondering what other features we should bring to you, dear reader.</p>

	<p>So why don&#8217;t you let us know? Any suggestions/criticism/feature requests are really appreciated, so please don&#8217;t hesitate.<br />
We&#8217;re looking forward to hear from you.</p>

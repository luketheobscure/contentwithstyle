    <p>Good question! We were about to ask ourselves the same question.
    Even though Matthias came up with a <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/161/figure-microformats/">new article</a> today, we cannot deny that not much that has happened here in the past couple of months. We&rsquo;re basically facing some descisions wether to leave CwS to die quietly, or to keep it alive &hellip; </p>

    <div class="comment-text">Folks, hang in there. We were actually discussing stuff, just that we are not sure about the look so far. Then I went to travel the world. But anyway, there will be an update sooner or later &#8230; So long</div>

    <div class="comment-text">And again there is news.<br />
    After a shockingly long period of not moving at all, and waiting until we all would agree on some design and so on, it emerged that we just wouldn&#8217;t have enough time to come up with a design ourselves.<br />
    Instead I appointed <a href="http://www.koopd.com">Alistair Holt</a> as designer for a simplified version of the site, wich will just become an ordinary blog, with hopefully more focus on content.  Whether that&#8217;s just from Matthias and me or if there will be other people contributing is not so clear at the moment. However, I appreciate you folks still reading my gibberish!</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Just to let everyone know. I started coding the the relaunch in PHP with Zend Framework, and it&#8217;s a pleasure. Expect me going on about Zend Framework quite a bit in the future.<br />
    Also Mike came through with some nice design suggestions, and I hope to give that a crack soon.<br />
    <br />
    It&#8217;ll all happen, even if we&#8217;re like a yar late or so. Nothing new to you, dear reader, I know &#8230;</div>

	<p>Good question! We were about to ask ourselves the same question.<br />
Even though Matthias came up with a <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/161/figure-microformats/">new article</a> today, we cannot deny that not much that has happened here in the past couple of months. We&#8217;re basically facing some descisions wether to leave CwS to die quietly, or to keep it alive &#8230; </p>

	<p>... and the bad news is: We&#8217;re all awfully busy at the moment. In fact we&#8217;re so busy, that with the way the site is set up currently, we&#8217;re sure we cannot make it a more lively place, as none of us really has the time to write full fledged articles. And since we didn&#8217;t even get around to set up a pagination yet, the Blog hasn&#8217;t really got the capacity to grow much more, either &#8230;</p>

	<p><strong>BUT:</strong></p>

	<p>We don&#8217;t want CwS to die like this. We&#8217;ve made up our minds, and we decided to invest some serious time into a brand new CwS, wich will happen somewhen in the beginning of 2008. We&#8217;re going to have a new design, we&#8217;ll migrate to a new platform, we&#8217;re going to focus on the blog more, with many more authors, still have the occasional article, we&#8217;re going to introduce a new categorizations, and we&#8217;re pondering what other features we should bring to you, dear reader.</p>

	<p>So why don&#8217;t you let us know? Any suggestions/criticism/feature requests are really appreciated, so please don&#8217;t hesitate.<br />
We&#8217;re looking forward to hear from you.</p>

    <p>I came across this <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2006-January/360901.html">very elaborate explanation of MVC</a> in a python mailing list.
    Just want to take this as an occasion to say thank you to all people that take time to explain things in mailing lists.

    <div class="comment-text">More content sure would be nice, but we&#8217;re in the process of planning the next, improved CwS. <br />
    Also it would be great if people stopped plugging some of their websites into comments, to up the ranking for i.e. a travel company website, so I don&#8217;t have to use rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; and comment reviews, don&#8217;t you think, mate?</div>

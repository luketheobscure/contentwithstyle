    <p>With new(ish) releases of mooTools and jQuery, both racing for the smallest sized libraries and the most effective code, what do you use for your Javascript needs?</p>

	<p>If you came across some of my comments in other blogs about this subject, you probably know already that I&#8217;m a moo-man.<br />
<a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">moo.fx</a>, the addons moo.dom and moo.ajax, I found them really easy to use. <br />
They have been derived from the early releases of <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype</a> (which I initially used as well), and the mentioned libraries come with a lite version of that, stripped to the bear essentials. Now <a href="http://mad4milk.net/">mad4milk</a> has released their <a href="http://mootools.net/">mootools</a>, basically a rewrite of the existing libraries, and a nice downloads page where you can mix and match modules for your needs, compiled into one handy file.<br />
If you want to check or extend the code, download an unpacked version for your perusal, only to use a packed version when going live. So many things can be done with such little files. Crazy. <br />
It also incorporates a version of <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/06/again/">Dean Edwards&#8217; DOMContentLoaded</a>.</p>

	<p>Mike&#8217;s library of choice is <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, which itself stems from prototype (and it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2010602,00.asp">partly based</a> on <a href="http://www.mad4milk.net/entry/links-of-interest">moo.fx</a>, too). It came up with the same concept of keeping the filesize low, and it&#8217;s selling point must be the <a href="http://www.visualjquery.com/">excellent documentation</a>. It possibly used to be the pick and mix download panel, but that&#8217;s &#8220;borrowed&#8221; back and improved by mootools now.<br />
They have in turn released the first issue of <a href="http://www.visualjquery.com/magazine/">Visual jQuery magazine</a> to help their and their developer community&#8217;s cause.<br />
But the biggest present for their own first birthday must be the release of <a href="http://jquery.com/blog/2007/01/14/jquery-birthday-11-new-site-new-docs/">jQuery 1.1</a> a couple of days ago. The improvements seem massive, and I&#8217;m very tempted to switch&#8230; </p>

	<p>Both of these come from prototype, which I got to know around the same time as the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a>. Prototype is very well integrated into Ruby on Rails, and liked by many in combination with the <a href="http://www.ujs4rails.com/">UJS Rails plugin</a>. Sadly, both prototype and dojo are, compared to the aforementioned libraries, quite heavy, and I don&#8217;t need their particular features in my projects. </p>

	<p>Content with Style&#8217;s own Pascal uses mainly moo.ajax and <a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behaviour</a> to easily register, well, behaviours on dom elements. He extends those with custom written object literals in order to ensure separated scopes.<br />
All of us tend to pick and mix for our needs, extending where necessary, always with an eye on filesize.</p>

	<p>Of course there&#8217;s <a href="http://edevil.wordpress.com/2005/11/14/javascript-libraries-roundup/">a million more javascript libraries</a>, and a bazillion ways to use them. That leads me to the question: What do you use? Is it in commercial projects, and where do you see the importance of a filesize/used code ratio? Have you abandoned other frameworks because you found something more tailored to your needs?</p>

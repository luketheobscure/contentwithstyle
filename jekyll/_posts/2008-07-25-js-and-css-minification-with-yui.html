	<p>At the moment I am working on a large website project for <a href="http://uktv.co.uk">UKTV</a>, where for maintainability reasons I keep files separated and pretty verbose.<br />
Every box and page type would get its own CSS file, and all would be included through one big CSS, which looks somehow like this:</p>

<pre><code>
@import url('../global/tools.css');
@import url('../global/foo.css');
@import url('../global/bar.css');
@import url('../content/foo.css');
@import url('../content/bar.css');
@import url('../sidebar/foo.css');
@import url('../sidebar/bar.css');
</code></pre>

	<p>The same would go for the JS files, which were broken down into class files and then included one by one:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/js/project.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/js/project/foo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/js/project/bar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

	<p>All together this generated more than different 35 hits, something that inevitably makes the rendering of an HTML page very slow.</p>

	<p>The solution came to me when my friend Simon from <a href="http://seventytwo.co.uk/">Seventytwo</a> highlighted the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI compression tools</a> to me, first just as a <a href="http://bundleforge.com/">Textmate bundle</a>, but then he pointed out to me that there is <a href="http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/">a jar file</a> for it as well.</p>

	<p>20 minutes and one little shellscript later I have one CSS files and one JS file, all nicely minified, plus an IE6 and IE7 stylesheet in conditional comments. </p>

<pre><code>
cat 
./templates/css/global/tools.css 
./templates/css/global/layout.css 
./templates/css/global/foo.css 
./templates/css/global/bar.css 
./templates/css/global/flyouts.css 
./templates/css/content/foo.css 
./templates/css/content/bar.css 
./templates/css/sidebar/foo.css 
./templates/css/sidebar/bar.css 
> ./templates/css/shared_concated.css

java -jar yuicompressor-2.3.5.jar 
./templates/css/shared_concated.css > 
./templates/css/shared_minified.css

rm ./templates/css/shared_concated.css

cat 
./templates/js/project.js 
./templates/js/project/foo.js 
./templates/js/project/bar.js 
> ./templates/js/project_concated.js

java -jar yuicompressor-2.3.5.jar 
./templates/js/project_concated.js > 
./templates/js/project_minified.js

rm ./templates/js/project_concated.js
</code></pre>

<p>Neat, me thinks!</p>

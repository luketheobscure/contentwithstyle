    <div class="comment-text">Basically it was, well still is actually, a cache folder that fills up over time and never gets emptied by the system. I spent quite a while to figure out what was using up all my space on the box, and was flabbergasted to find it in form of thousands and thousands of little cache files. Emptying this folder took about an half hour or so &#8230;</div>

	<p>I had trouble with deleting files, because a simple</p>

	<pre><code>rm -Rf *</code></pre>

	<p>would fail because the argument list was to long.<br />
<a href="http://www.cyberdummy.co.uk">Tom</a> , my former co-worker from <a href="http://www.redwiredesign.com">Redwire</a> times, pointed out that I should utilize xargs.</p>

	<p>A simple </p>

	<pre><code>ls | xargs rm -f</code></pre>

	<p>took quite a while, but did the trick!</p>

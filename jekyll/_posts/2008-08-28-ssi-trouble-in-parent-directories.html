	<p>Sometimes it helps to read the manual, especially when one makes a really silly mistake.</p>

	<p>For example today I tried to figure out which permission prevented my SSI based pages to work if the include file was to sit in the parent directory.</p>

	<p>Of course, when one reads a <a href="http://russell.dyerhouse.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?article_id=84">manual</a> and looks for &#8220;relative paths&#8221; one will find that there is the &#8220;file&#8221; attribute in the include statement which resolves system paths, but also there is the &#8220;virtual&#8221; attribute which resolves relative paths. DOH!</p>

	<p>P.S.: Classic example for &#8220;Dealt with a problem many times but always keep forgetting the solution&#8221; ...</p>

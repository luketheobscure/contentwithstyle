	<p>My co-worker <a href="http://fuzzyoutline.com/">Paul</a> showed how helpful it is to question the obvious: Can you apply a background image to an image?</p>

	<p>And, as he found out, the answer is: Yes!</p>

	<p>Switch the image to display: block, apply a padding, and there you go, you can set up backgrounds for images &#8230;</p>

	<p>See the <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/resources/img_bg_demo/index.html">little demo</a> I&#8217;ve built to achieve a paralax like scrolling with just a div and an img.</p>

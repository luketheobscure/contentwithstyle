	<p>One of the nicest things about <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> is the that you keep discovering things even after a year of using it. The project wide search and replace functionality already helped me, but I kept ignoring that little check box saying &#8220;Regular expression&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Of course, for someone that quite likes regular expressions, using search and replace with regular expression matches is a very powerful I gave it a try, fired up the project wide search (cmd+shift+F) and changed CSS file names in various locations and folders by searching for </p>

	<p>href=&#8221;(.+)foo.css&#8221; </p>

	<p>, then replaced it with </p>

	<p>href=&#8221;$1bar.css&#8221;</p>

	<p>and, after double checking for what it did, just clicked on File->Save All (alt+cmd+S).</p>

	<p>Very powerful, very neat!<br />
One thing that I am still missing, though, is the muti-line search and replace field found in BBEdit or Homesite, which comes in handy when searching for whole blocks of HTML. Dealing with line breaks in the Textmate search is just too fiddly, and maybe there&#8217;s a better way but I haven&#8217;t found it yet? </p>

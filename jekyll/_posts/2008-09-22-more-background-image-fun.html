	<p>Tying in with Pascal&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Blog/183/css-background-image-on-html-image-element/">post about background images for images</a>, here is more image-related css magic, this time combined with a little jQuery, to create beautifully animated rollover effects (or whatever trigger you can think of, progress bars etc). Yay, eyecandy!</p>

	<p>If you like it or not is of course personal preference, but I think Jonathan Snook&#8217;s <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/jquery-bg-image-animations/">examples of utilizing jQuery to animate background images</a> are very slick, especially because it&#8217;s only using fairly obvious techniques.</p>

	<p>His work is based on the <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/sprites2">ideas of Dave Shea</a> in an article in the late August issue of A List Apart, but he cleans up and improves the readability of the css by miles.</p>

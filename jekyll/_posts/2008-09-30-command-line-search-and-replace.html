<p>
So I'm asking around for the best way to do search and replace in command line ... I have to copy files into another folder, but replace one word.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cyberdummy.co.uk/">Tom</a> pointed me towards using perl:
</p>

<pre><code>
cp ./source/* ./destination/
cd ./destination/
perl -pi -e 's/foo/bar/' * 
</code></pre>

<p>
<a href="http://www.redwiredesign.com/profile/justin_finkelstein.html">Justin</a> in contrast uses sed, and a loop:
</p>

<pre><code>
cd ./source
for A in `ls`; do  echo sed 's/foo/bar/' $A > ./destination/$A; done;
</code></pre>

<p>
Which brought me to finally look into the man pages for <a href="http://lowfatlinux.com/linux-sed.html">sed</a> , the linux stream editor.
Apparanetly the -i flag enables in-place editing there as well, and you could do something like tom did with sed:
</p>


<pre><code>
cp ./source/* ./destination/
cd ./destination/
sed -i '' 's/foo/bar/' *
</code></pre>

<p>
Initially, trying the -i flag, I got weird warnings like this:
<br />
sed: 1: "index.shtml": command i expects  followed by text
</p>

<p>
This is due to the missing extension that you need to provide for the -i flag, in the case above I used '' to not create any backup files.
If you provide '.bak' it will create backup files, i.e. index.shtml.bak before editing.
</p>

<p>
Happy search and replace!

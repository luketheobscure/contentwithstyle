    <div class="comment-text">I have seen this and have mixed opinions about it. 
    It makes sense on some levels and doesn\'t on some other levels. 
    It\'s true that there needs to be a structured and automated approach for CSS development to keep simple, clean and lean for optimal performance. </div>

	<p>Very very good slides for download at <a href="http://natbat.net/2008/Sep/28/css-systems/">natbat.net</a> , and a nice discussion in the comments as well.</p>

	<p>Interestingly Natalie Downe argues against CSS frameworks as such, but for a structured and reusable approach. Myself, I have never utilized a CSS framework, and apart from a little toolset for clearfix and inline-block I write every CSS for a site from scratch.</p>

	<p>I like the fact that she takes version control into consideration when she chooses against multiple rule statements in one line, which is something that I have to argue again and again &#8230;</p>

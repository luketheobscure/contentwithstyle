	<p>I had this great moment in my kitchen recently, when we had a new washing machine and fridge delivered.<br />
The delivery guys were in a bit of a rush, and our road as well as our hallway are fairly narrow, which added to the tension. So, instead of doing the logical thing of taking the old appliances out first, they decided to roll the new boxed up ones in right away.<br />
This created a comedy scene I&#8217;ll never forget: 4 people in the kitchen, one big kitchen table, and 4 boxes that had to be moved in a specific order into a specific place. Real life Sokoban! Needless to say, I cracked up laughing, leaving my wife puzzled and one of the delivery guys visibly angry.</p>

	<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Sokoban is an old computer game <br />
<cite>in which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from above, and tries to put them in designated locations. Only one box may be pushed at a time, and boxes cannot be pulled. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game.</cite> (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">wikipedia</a>)</p>

	<p>After that I felt the urge to play Sokoban again. Finding the original on the web wasn&#8217;t too hard, although I won&#8217;t give you a link here. Use google wisely and live with the fact that you&#8217;re illegally downloading a random collection of exe files that might or might not unleash hell on your machines.</p>

	<p>I felt that it&#8217;s a great time waster and banned it from my work, instead I tried and bought <a href="http://www.gtsystem.eu/naboko/">Naboko</a> for the iPhone, which is amazing. The shear fact that it has something like 2400 levels, made by a handful of bright mathematical-type brainiacs is astonishing. One of them is <a href="http://sapiens.ya.com/sokobanhomz/intro.html">Marti Homs</a>, who has contributed a ton of levels to Naboko, but also set them up online to play in a javascript version, built by another, <a href="http://sokoban.e-contento.com/en.index.php">Juan Antonio Jim&#233;nez</a>, who has done the same with his levels as well as the original levels the game came.</p>

	<p>Enjoy!</p>

	<p>Today my folder for mailing list digests hit the mark of 3500 unread mails. Time to cut them off, I think.</p>

	<p>Already checking the uk-usability list, I subscribed to 5 more of them at around the time Content with Style went online, so that&#8217;s May 2005 or so. And I used to read a lot of the digests, sometimes helping a lost developer on the way, sometimes pimping our site.</p>

	<p>Maybe three times I actually asked a technical question in the more or less anonymous round, but as far as I remember, never got a useful reply (so I had to wait until shaun inman promoted the obvious, using opacity to style the file input/submit button <strong>without</strong> deleting the value). What I got instead is an average of 10 spam mails a day. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not all bad, though. First of all there were a lot of hacks and small insights learnt on every list, not so much the &#8220;how to do it&#8221;, but rather the &#8220;how to do it better&#8221; or &#8220;how to do it differently&#8221;. Then there&#8217;s the exception to all the others, the rest-discuss list on yahoo groups. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve seen questions replied that would make people understand the possibilities and concept of REST, also there&#8217;s not a lot of comments that tell you to use google, RTFM or what else.</p>

	<p>But enough is enough, and now is the time to cut down on this mess. It&#8217;s all archived online, so I don&#8217;t need to do that. Before I delete this part of my career development, I want to let you know my recommendations for your development needs, whenever google lets you down:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.chinwag.com/lists/uk-usability">uk usability</a>: pretty silent most of the time, but reasonable questions are usually discussed instead of given the silent treatment</li>
		<li><a href="http://news.php.net/php.i18n">php-i8n</a>: One list that helped me close the serious gap in my programming knowledge about how to deal with planning and building websites with different languages and character encodings.</li>
		<li><a href="http://news.php.net/php.db">php-db</a>: This one seems to have more of a junior crowd appeal, for folks new to dealing with the server side of things. No use for me now, not bad back then. There&#8217;s <a href="http://news.php.net/">tons more specialized php mailing lists</a>, by the way.</li>
		<li><a href="http://lists.evolt.org/">thelist@evolt</a> and </li>
		<li><a href="http://www.webdesign-l.com/">webdesign-l</a>: Both the evolt list and webdesign-l are very likeable, each have a reasonably sized group of returning and helpful contributors. Member of those lists were so kind to help me (mostly off-list) when I started out as freelancer, and I&#8217;d love to contribute more than my current total of maybe half a dozen replies if I ever have a less time-demanding job. Another <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/tenyears">authority on web development</a> recently bigged them up, too.</li>
		<li><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/">rest-discuss@yahoogroups</a>: As I said above, a brilliant resource, and a brilliant discussion forum. Definitely sign up when you grind your teeth on REST. I think I still owe them a long announced, never completed Ajax-to-REST demo.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Never forget the etiquette: Try googling it first, also look into the archive of the list you&#8217;d like to ask, and try to understand the issue at hand. Be nice, be concise, and help others if you can.</p>

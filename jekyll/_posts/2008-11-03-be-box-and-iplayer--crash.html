<p>I thought I was going mad: Everytime I watched some iplayer content,
my wireless dropped out and it looked like the router reset itself.
</p>

<p>Then, last time I tried it was all fine, and I kind of forgot about it. But <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2008/oct/30/vista-wifi">a post on the Guardians "Ask Jack"</a> blog about trouble with wireless remined me of my troubles. Curiosity prompted me to look in the <a href="https://www.bethere.co.uk/">be</a> forums now, and I found <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/28/bt_router_bbc_iplayer_bug/">a BBC article on it</a>, that a) tells me I'm not crazy and b) they fixed it. YAY!</p>

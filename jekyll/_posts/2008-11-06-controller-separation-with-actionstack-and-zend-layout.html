    <p>Thinking about my past projects, I realized that previously my
    controllers where doing way too much that they shouldn't, and quickly
    the comments controller would update user content and so on. I had
    a good look at how I wanted to structure my code, and
    decided that the controllers only should do things that belong to them,
    but call other controllers if they needed stuff from them.</p>

<p>Thinking about my past projects, I realized that previously my
controllers where doing way too much that they shouldn't, and quickly
the comments controller would update user content and so on. I had
a good look at how I wanted to structure my code, and
decided that the controllers only should do things that belong to them,
but call other controllers if they needed stuff from them.</p>

<h2>A Built In Solution</h2>

<p>The Zend view renderer actually gives you a mechanism for this. In
every action you can set the response segment that you are targeting.
In combination with the action stack helper, this enables you to call
all the actions that you need and then output all the response segments
you have created where you'd need them within the layout, separating
bits of markup into single actions.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at a code example:</p>
<pre><code>
class FooController extends BaseController {
 public function indexAction() {
 $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;actionStack('list', 'foo');
 $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;actionStack('foo', 'bar');
 $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;actionStack('bar', 'bar');
 }

 public function listAction() {
 $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;viewRenderer-&gt;setResponseSegment('list');
 }
}

class BarController extends BaseController
{
 public function fooAction() {
 $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;viewRenderer-&gt;setResponseSegment('foo');
 }

 public function barAction() {
 $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;viewRenderer-&gt;setResponseSegment('bar');
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then in the layout:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
 echo $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;bar; 
 echo $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;foo; 
 echo $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;list; 
?&gt; </code></pre><h2>Further Reading</h2><ul>

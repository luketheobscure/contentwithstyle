    <p>Via the <a href="http://ajaxian.com">ajaxian</a> I came across the new javascript based framework <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/greimer/entry/reglib_javascript_library_now_available">reglib</a>, written by Gregory Reimer. It is based on some very clever thoughts and makes heavy use of <a href="http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/">Event Delegation</a>.</p>

    <div class="comment-text">I know there was quite a bit of talk about this at the time, both between us and at the PubStandards, but I didn\'t listen in too much. Now that I had the time to read up on it, I\'m very impressed.
    <br /><br />
    Although jQuery doesn\'t do this by nature (or it didn\'t do it back in February 08), some smart people have happily extended it. 
    <br /><br />
    One of them is Pub Standards own Dan Webb, using it in his LowPro project and offering a prototype version too: <a href=\"http://www.danwebb.net/2008/2/8/event-delegation-made-easy-in-jquery\">http://www.danwebb.net/2008/2/8/event-delegation-made-easy-in-jquery</a>

    Another one is scarily enough from around the same time AND it looks almost the same, on dev.distilldesign: <a href=\"http://dev.distilldesign.com/log/2008/jan/27/event-delegation-jquery/\">http://dev.distilldesign.com/log/2008/jan/27/event-delegation-jquery/</a></div>

<p>Via the <a href="http://ajaxian.com">ajaxian</a> I came across the javascript based framework <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/greimer/entry/reglib_javascript_library_now_available">reglib</a>, written by Gregory Reimer. It is based on some very clever thoughts and makes heavy use of <a href="http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/">Event Delegation</a>.</p><p>Event Delegation is a technique I used quite a lot at Tesco. Back then <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewjdunn">Matt Dunn</a>, who was the lead UI developer there, introduced me to its benefits and how it <a href="http://cherny.com/webdev/70/javascript-event-delegation-and-event-hanlders">helps to keep the memory footprint down</a>.</p><p>reglib goes a step further. It utilizes the body element as single entry point for all events, and identifies the nodes that triggered the event so it can match them with&nbsp; functions that were assigned through the library and execute them.</p><p>This cuts out the wait for until the DOM is<span> Loaded by the browser, something that is pretty much essential and implemented into most other frameworks like <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Events/ready">JQuery</a> or <a href="http://mootools.net/docs/Utilities/DomReady">MooTools</a></span>. Gregory Reimer, who has written reglib based on his work for <a href="http://www.sun.com">sun.com</a>, seems to dislike this and even <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/greimer/entry/on_the_inelegance_of_modern">describes this as anti-pattern</a>.</p>

    <p>If you think that Firebug is the end-all of http monitoring, have a good look at Charles. Jonathan Snook wrote a nice review about it that I'd like to share with you.</p>

    I have just used the good old CLI packet sniffer in the past, like <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/\">TCPDUMP</a>. MacScoop obviously looks a bit nicer than that, but essentially the same.

    Of course tapping your network interface is a little less intrusive than proxy settings, but I must admit that the graphical iterface of charles is excelent for inspecting the response data.

    <div class="comment-text">Nice! Reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.tuffcode.com/\">HTTP Scoop from Tuffcode</a> which doesn\'t use proxy but is probably a little less feature full than Charles.</div>

    <div class="comment-text">It would be awesome if Charles had a network interface mode of sorts. Or if HTTP Scoop was to clone Charles\' UI and features.
    
    Somewhat off-topic: My main gripe with Firebug is that I can\'t log anything to a file. I\'d use these things for later comparison, or for things like FirePHP messages when the page is redirected (and the messages are subsequently gone again). Am I just stupid or is there no way to do this (let\'s say for the console, but also other bits)?

    <div class="comment-text">@Alastair: tried out HTTPScoop, and have been using it since early 2009, and in tandem they are both amazing. I\'m testing my sites locally, and the communication with webservices is nicely collected in HTTPScoop, while I collect my browser comms with Charles. Hurrah!</div>

    <div class="comment-text">Yay, with the update to Version 1.4.3, HTTPScoop can now deal with Tunnelblick openVPN on OSX 10.5. Mine at least, there were reports that it was working before, and Matthias must\'ve been doing something wrong. Well, not any more!</div>

<p>I've been mentioning <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a> in comments here and on other sites for a good 3 years now. It's been a great companion in debugging server communication with flash and ajax applications, especially before firebug had its network monitoring capabilities.</p><p>Jonathan Snook, who has been writing a consistently amazing blog for many years now, has written <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/review/charles-http-monitoring/">a post about how he monitors his HTTP traffic with Charles</a>, and he seems to use a setup very similar to what I use; Charles as a weapon of choice, when you're not 100% on what the server/client sends, when you need to resend requests to the server, etc. and the Firefox extension <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">Live HTTP Headers</a> when you want to see what the result does in your browser.</p><p>He writes: </p><p>"Charles ia a cross-platform desktop application that acts as a proxy
for all web requests, no matter what browser they come from; it can
even inspect Flash-originated requests and Adobe AIR application
requests. As the proxy, it's able to see all the information flowing
back and forth and provide a detailed peek at every request and
response. </p><p>One of my favourite features — and where it stands out from the
Firefox addons — is the ability to view XML, JSON and even AMF data
structures. It's easy to see right away if a request was successful or
not and you get access to all of the request and response headers."</p><p>I can only recommend that you give it a spin.</p>

<p>I've been mentioning <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a> in comments here and on other sites for a good 3 years now. It's been a great companion in debugging server communication with flash and ajax applications, especially before firebug had its network monitoring capabilities.</p><p>Jonathan Snook, who has been writing a consistently amazing blog for many years now, has written <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/review/charles-http-monitoring/">a post about how he monitors his HTTP traffic with Charles</a>, and he seems to use a setup very similar to what I use; Charles as a weapon of choice, when you're not 100% on what the server/client sends, when you need to resend requests to the server, etc. and the Firefox extension <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">Live HTTP Headers</a> when you want to see what the result does in your browser.</p><p>He writes: </p><p>"Charles ia a cross-platform desktop application that acts as a proxy
for all web requests, no matter what browser they come from; it can
even inspect Flash-originated requests and Adobe AIR application
requests. As the proxy, it's able to see all the information flowing
back and forth and provide a detailed peek at every request and
response. </p><p>One of my favourite features — and where it stands out from the
Firefox addons — is the ability to view XML, JSON and even AMF data
structures. It's easy to see right away if a request was successful or
not and you get access to all of the request and response headers."</p><p>I can only recommend that you give it a spin.</p>

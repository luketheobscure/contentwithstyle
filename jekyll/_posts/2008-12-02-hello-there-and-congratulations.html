<p>The last week was full of events for two of us. <a href="http://www.willerich.com/900days/2008/12/crossing-the-start-line/">While Matthias has just started the most amazing start-up one can think of</a>, I went past my use-by date to hit the magic number: 30.</p>

<p>And in order to avoid the struggle with loads of guests at some weird party that makes me wanna be 18 again, I tried to escape by going to Big Apple and celebrate thanksgiving with a 19 lbs turkey.</p>

<p>I felt a bit drowsy thereafter, and couldn't get myself to write anything ... Matthias sure had better reasons not to write anything, <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/content/charles-proxy-review-by-snookca">but somehow he managed</a>. I hope he's got some sleep, finally. In any case, forgive us dear reader. We'll be on the case again soon.</p>

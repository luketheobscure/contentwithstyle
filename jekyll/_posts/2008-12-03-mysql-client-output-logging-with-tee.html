<p>James, the sys admin guy here at <a href="http://www.sportingstatz.com/">Opta</a>, where I am working at the moment, brought this up, and it is one of those neat tricks that can make life very easy but I still didn't know about.</p><p>A look in the <a href="http://www.aip.de/%7Eweber/doc/mysql/manual_Client-Side_Scripts.html">manual</a> reveals that in the command line 'tee /path/to/file.txt' sets the output file, and 'notee' unsets it and therefore stops the logging.</p><p>Alternatively \T and \t can be used.</p><p>Happy logging.</p>

<p>At the moment I am looking for a nice way to convert HTML tables into stats. I am thinking along the lines of <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/12/sifr-2.0-release-candidate-2">SIFR</a>, where flash replaces markup and displays dynamic data. But first I need something that displays dynamic stats ...</p>


<h2>Flash Based:</h2>

<p>The first thing that I found was <a href="http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/">XML/SWF Charts</a>, which did look brilliant at first glance. Unfortunately the free version includes a link to their homepage, whenever one clicks on the object, and of course that's out of discussion.</p>

<p>I then looked at <a href="http://www.fusioncharts.com/Free/">FusionCharts Free</a>, but didn't find a way to quickly modify the shadows for the bar charts. Another Google search lead me to <a href="http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/bar-chart.php">Open Flash Chart 2</a>, which pretty much does want I want it to.</p>

<p>All of the above are meant to work with a datafile that is loaded, like XML or JSON, and to get them to work with inline data requires a bit of JavaScript trickery, as this example for OpenFlashChart illustrates:</p>

<pre><code class="js">
function get_data(id) {
 return $.toJSON(data_obj);
}

var data_obj = { 
  "elements": [ { "type": "bar", "values": [ 9, 8] } ], 
  "title": { "text": "Thu Dec 04 2008" } 
};
var swf_config = { "get-data": "get_data", "id": "my_chart"};
$.swfobject.embedSWF("../3rdparty/open_flash_chart_2/open-flash-chart.swf", "my_chart", "200", "200", "9.0.0", "expressInstall.swf", swf_config);
</code></pre>

<p>
Not ideal in my books, I thought to myself, but I could work around this somehow. Some further Google search (and at the same time, Matthias), however, pointed me towards solutions based on the canvas tag.
</p>

<h2>Canvas Based:</h2>

<p>The lack of support for canvas in IE was one of the reasons for me to pretty much ignore it. Probably the reason why I missed the ventures that try to work around the lack of support, namely a<a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/using-canvas-in-ie-via-flash"> flash based canvas integration</a>, but also an emulated <a href="http://me.eae.net/archive/2005/12/29/canvas-in-ie/">canvas for IE</a> implementation based on SVG, and its successor, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/excanvas/">excanvas</a>.</p>

<p>Some tools utilizing this technique are <a href="http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/">PlotKit</a>, <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html">WebFX Chart</a>, its rewrite <a href="http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Canvas+Charts#download">Canvas Charts</a> and <a href="http://bluff.jcoglan.com/">Bluff</a>.</p>

<p>I managed to quickly get something off the ground with Bluff, and not only does the built in facility to use an HTML table as data source works great towards what I want to do, but the whole script looks considerably more tidy as well:</p>

<pre><code class="js">
window.onload = function() {
var g = new Bluff.Mini.Bar('example', 400);
 g.theme_keynote();
 g.minimum_value = 0;
 g.maximum_value = 10;
 g.data_from_table('data');
 g.draw(); 
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Others:</h2>

<p>Of course there is a variety of other techniques and APIs to generate charts and stats. From the <a href="http://www.smashingapps.com/2008/01/10/the-google-chart-api-lets-you-dynamically-generate-free-charts-in-your-website.html">Google Charts API</a> down to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVG-TT-Graph/">Perl based CPAN modules that generate SVG</a>. But most of those won't work on the client, but will require some server action, and client based rendering was one of my initial requirements.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line:</h2>

<p>It will canvas rather than SWF based charts, I think.</p>

<p>Also it seams that canvas offers better answers to the problems that we were facing before, like the image replacement for headlines, nicely tackled by <a href="http://css-tricks.com/typefacejs-a-sifr-alternative/">Typface.js</a>.</p> 

<p>While for some of you web folks this might all be yesterdays news, I am amazed about how far the dynamic client side has come now. The <a href="http://squeedlyspooch.com/firelight/xaml.xhtml">Silverlight implementation without Silverlight</a>, for example, is a step that goes so far beyond anything that I'd have ever expected, that I can only say: Amazing stuff.</p>

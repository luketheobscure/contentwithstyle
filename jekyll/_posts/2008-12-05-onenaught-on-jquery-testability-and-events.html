<p>Over at <a href="http://www.onenaught.com">OneNaught</a> Anup Shah gives some <a href="http://www.onenaught.com/posts/85/turn-your-jquery-code-into-a-richer-unit-testable-plugin">hints about how to utilize Events to make your jQuery plugins ready for unit testing</a>.</p>

<p>Anup is one of the head developers at <a href="http://www.ivisgriup.com">IVIS</a>, a company that I was contracting for in the past. They heavily use XSLT, and very often Anup steps up as the main advocate for standards based techniques in an environment where not every middle-tier developer cares about quality markup and accessibility.</p>

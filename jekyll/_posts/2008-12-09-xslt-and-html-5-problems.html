<p>Sometimes I'm really getting annoyed about the lack of control that
XSLT sometimes gives about what target formats are supported and what
output it generates</p>

<p>I'm trying to utilize a canvas tag, and <a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">excanvas</a>. Now the problem that I'm having is that excanvas is hooking up to onreadystatechange, and therefore will be executed before the ondomready event that jQuery offers.</p>

<p>Which means I have to either do inline JS, and generate the canvas tags per JS, in order to create valid HTML 4, or I have to use the HTML 5 Doctype and can write the canvas tag in there just like that.</p>

<p>Problem is: XSLT 1.0 doesn't support the HTML 5 to generate a doctype, and the output encoding meta tag that it selfishly applies is not valid in HTML 5 either. Any ideas anyone?</p>

<h2><em>UPDATE</em></h2>

<p>
Quite a fruitful discussion in the comments.
<br />
So for anyone else who's reading this: Bottom line is that, even with existing technology for XSLT, it is possible to create HTML 5.
</p>

<p>
The first issue we were discussing was the DTD. HTML 5 in its current draft caters the generation with XSLT by providing a fallback DTD:
</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "XSLT-compat"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
The other issue was the meta tag with the charset attribute, that HTML 5 introduces in order to target the character set: 
</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;meta charset="..." /&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>
It is just not possible to generate exactly that with libXSL, because libXSL forcefully replaces it with an HTML 4 style meta tag. 
</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
This is not a problem though, as the old meta tag in its encoding state is a valid declaration of the character set, too.

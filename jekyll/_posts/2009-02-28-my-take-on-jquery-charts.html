<p>A while back I did <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/search/canvas">a couple of posts</a> touching the subject HTML 5 and the canvas tag. Of course I have been tinkering around with chart drawing APIs and so on, and couldn't help to write a little script myself.</p>

<p>I started out with pie charts, and essentially did a mashup between <a href="http://joncom.be/code/excanvas-piechart">Jon Combes approach</a> and <a href="http://www.mattknott.com/content/blog/2008/04/Advanced_Canvas_Based_Pie_Chart.html">Advanced Canvas Based Pie Chart by Matthew Knott</a>, then wrapped a JQuery plugin around it.</p>

<p>Later I added some sidebar charts, which were much simpler to do and don't require to understand the fact that javascript does trigonometric functions in radians rather than degrees, a fact that made my brain boil when I tried to add in the labels, because I was expecting different numbers to come back from my calculations ...</p>

<p>I was keen on passing the chart values in as array, so I could gather data from an HTML table with a couple of lines of JS, for example. I left this out in <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/resources/jquery_canvascharts_demo/index.html">the little demo that I mocked up</a>, which I uploaded <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/resources/jquery_canvascharts_demo.zip">as a zip file</a> as well, but I am sure you guys figure what I mean.</p>

<p>The whole thing is nothing new, and <a href="http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/">Plotkit</a> or <a href="http://bluff.jcoglan.com">Bluff</a> are way more advanced, but I think it's a nice little demo to read and understand, without being overwhelmed by large files of code. So I hope you enjoy it.</p>

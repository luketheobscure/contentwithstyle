<p>In order to run my unit tests, I needed to get phpunit running with MAMP. Thanks to the <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/2009/installing-phpunit-with-mamp/">helpful post of Mark Kirby</a> on this, I figured it out.</p>

<ol>
<li>cd into your PEAR installation directory</li>
<li>Make backup of phpunit file in bin folder</li>
<li>Edit the original file, replace #!/usr/bin/php with #!/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/bin/php</li> 
<li>3. Also remove this:
<pre><code>
if (strpos('/usr/bin/php', '@php_bin') === 0) {
    set_include_path(dirname(__FILE__) . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
}
</code></pre></li>
<li>And finally, something that Mark didn't mention, add PEAR include path into /Applications/MAMP/conf/php5/php.ini</li>
</ol>

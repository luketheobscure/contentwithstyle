    <p>In order to run my unit tests, I needed to get phpunit running with MAMP. Thanks to the <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/2009/installing-phpunit-with-mamp/">helpful post of Mark Kirby</a> on this, I figured it out.</p>

    <div class="comment-text"><p>Pardon my absolute ignorance in PEAR but </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>what is the PEAR include path?</li>
    
    <li>my pear.conf file looks like the result of a serialized PHP array. Is this normal? Do add the path to the bottom?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Thanks.</p></div>

    <li>The PEAR include path is the path in your php.ini that enables PEAR modules to be included</li>
    <li>Yes, it is normal, for the pear.conf. No, the path needs to be in the php.ini. Sorry, my fault, I corrected this.</li></div>

<p>In order to run my unit tests, I needed to get phpunit running with MAMP. Thanks to the <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/2009/installing-phpunit-with-mamp/">helpful post of Mark Kirby</a> on this, I figured it out.</p>

<ol>
<li>cd into your PEAR installation directory</li>
<li>Make backup of phpunit file in bin folder</li>
<li>Edit the original file, replace #!/usr/bin/php with #!/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/bin/php</li> 
<li>3. Also remove this:
<pre><code>
if (strpos('/usr/bin/php', '@php_bin') === 0) {
    set_include_path(dirname(__FILE__) . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
}
</code></pre></li>
<li>And finally, something that Mark didn't mention, add PEAR include path into /Applications/MAMP/conf/php5/php.ini</li>
</ol>

<p>About three months ago I suffered a contractors nightmare: An injury that meant I couldn't work for quite some time.</p>

<p>In my instance it was a very nasty episode of lower back pain, which made me go through a month of not being able to tie my shoes. Of course it could have been worse. I did have a break planned anyway (ironically it was to get fit and do the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunwich_Dynamo">Dunwich Dynamo</a>) so I didn't have to bail out of a current contracting situation, and I was lucky that my osteopath didn't confirm my fears and sent me to hospital to have any surgery done. However, I didn't feel OK with taking on any contracting job for two and a half months, and I did spend quite some money on sessions to get my spine clicked into position. Also, following the routine I was recommended means I have to do back and core strength exercises every day.</p>

<p>This is why I want to give you contractors out there a couple of words on your way:</p>

<h2>Stay healthy</h2>

<p>I know it sounds lame, but you might want to consider doing the exercises before the pain comes. This might keep you fit and healthy to cope with 8 to 10 hours sitting each day, plus it might also help to balance out the stress that sometimes comes with contracting work, deadlines and delivery dates.</p>

<h2>Look at your working environment</h2>

<p>If you can help it, make sure you get a good chair, the computer set up and all the rest. I am sure you know the drill.</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>In my case it didn't really matter that much, but what if I had kids, a mortgage and an ongoing contract? Clearly I should be insured against loss of income? There's a <a href="http://www.contractoruk.com/money/phi.html">pretty neat guide on Contractors UK about what to look for when you purchase insurance</a>. I recommend reading it and contemplating the necessary steps.</p>

<br />
<br />

<p>Finally, if you're suffering from back pain like I do, have a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LodlEH6TluM&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=FEC7C9FF242C8C6C&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=22">youtube</a>. The videos of yoga exercises have given me some good clues of what to incorporate into my exercise routine.</p>

<p>Also, If you have any tips to share, be it about injury prevention, workplace set up or experiences with insurance claims, please do!</p>

<p>Whatever prompted <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en-uk&amp;answer=64418">Google to use an "unbalanced" noscript tag in their Web Optimiser</a>, it ain't pretty!</p> 

<p>The problem is not just Web Optimiser, but also other tools like Analytics. The whole "generate me a code snippet to paste" approach leaves many many otherwise neatly coded littered with inline script blocks. While this is a quick and easy way for people to get stuff working in their WP blog, at least there should be a neat and valid alternative for experienced developers.</p>

<p>Why Google don't try to create cleaner ways to include their tools, is completely beyond me. They really have loads of skilled people at hand, so resource can't be a problem, can it?</p>

<p>Below is their generated Analytics code, vs my take on it the encapsulated way.</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." : "http://www.");
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
try{
var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-xxxxxx-x");
pageTracker._trackPageview();
} catch(err) {}&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
CWS.GoogleAnalytics = new function() {
  this.NS = 'CWS.GoogleAnalytics';
  var _t = 200;
  
  var _checkTracker = function() {
    if(window._gat !== undefined) {
        try {
          var pageTracker = window._gat._getTracker("UA-XXXXXXX-X");
          pageTracker._trackPageview();
        } catch(err) {}
    } else {
      window.setTimeout(_checkTracker, _t);      
    }
  }
  
  var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? 'https://ssl.' : 'http://www.');
  var str = unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E");
  $('body').append(str);

  window.setTimeout(_checkTracker, _t);
};
</code></pre>

<p>However, that doesn't solve the problem of Google Web Optimiser insisting on an "unbalanced" noscript tag. For all those people that use XML parsers or send their content as application/xhtml+xml, this is a big nono. Poor show, Google!</p>

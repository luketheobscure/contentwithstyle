    <p>
    Since I while I heard good things about nginx and wanted to use it for my Zend Framework MVC applications.
    I just got a Ubuntu server working after one of those days that seem to be a never ending Google search and debugging session, so I thought I'd share the outcome with you.

<h2>Install packages</h2>

<p>
First off you'll need to install a couple of packages, as outlined in the excellent <a href="http://davidwinter.me.uk/articles/2009/06/13/php-and-nginx-the-easy-way/">howto by david winter</a>:
</p>

<pre><code>sudo aptitude install php5-cgi nginx
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure PHP fastcgi</h2>

<p>Then create an init.d file to manage the php-fastcgi process</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/init.d/php-fastcgi
</code></pre>

<p>Inside put</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
BIND=127.0.0.1:9000
USER=www-data
PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=15
PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=1000

PHP_CGI=/usr/bin/php-cgi
PHP_CGI_NAME=`basename $PHP_CGI`
PHP_CGI_ARGS="- USER=$USER PATH=/usr/bin PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=$PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=$PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS $PHP_CGI -b $BIND"
RETVAL=0

start() {
      echo -n "Starting PHP FastCGI: "
      start-stop-daemon --quiet --start --background --chuid "$USER" --exec /usr/bin/env -- $PHP_CGI_ARGS
      RETVAL=$?
      echo "$PHP_CGI_NAME."
}
stop() {
      echo -n "Stopping PHP FastCGI: "
      killall -q -w -u $USER $PHP_CGI
      RETVAL=$?
      echo "$PHP_CGI_NAME."
}

case "$1" in
    start)
      start
  ;;
    stop)
      stop
  ;;
    restart)
      stop
      start
  ;;
    *)
      echo "Usage: php-fastcgi {start|stop|restart}"
      exit 1
  ;;
esac
exit $RETVAL
</code></pre>

<p>Then we change permissions on this, start the fastcgi and register it as startup item</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/php-fastcgi
sudo /etc/init.d/php-fastcgi start
sudo update-rc.d php-fastcgi defaults
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure nginx</h2>

<p>
Now we need to set up a vhost for ZF application in nginx.
This is a pretty straight forward job, as the nginx package in Ubuntu features the well knows sites-available/sites-enabled folder structure.
I will assume that the application lives in /var/www/zfapp, has all the needed dependencies in the library folder and the host name for it will be zfapp.
</p>

<p>First off we create a config file in the sites-available folder:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/zfapp</code></pre>

<p>Inside we put the vhost config:</p>

<pre><code>server {
        listen 80;
        server_name zfapp;
        root /var/www/zfapp/public;
        index /index.php;

        # remove trailing slash, that throws ZF router
        rewrite ^/(.*)/$ /$1 break;

        location / {
                # if file is existing, skip fastcgi parsing
                if (-e $request_filename) {
                        break;
                }

                fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
                fastcgi_index index.php;
                include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/zfapp/public/index.php;
                
                # get the relevant environment
                fastcgi_param APPLICATION_ENV staging;
        }

        # expires headers on known filetypes
        location ~* ^.+.(css|js|jpeg|jpg|gif|png|ico) {
                expires 30d;
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we just need to symlink this file into sites-enabled and restart nginx</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/zfapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/zfapp
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</code></pre>

<p>That's it. Should be working.</p>

<p>This is not at all from us, but from my colleague Andrew, who showed them to me last Friday in Perl.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I would use either of those in production code, it's... slightly cheeky. Nevertheless, enjoy:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
//turn anything into a boolean
$boolean_flag = <strong>!!</strong> $any_variable;
//does the same as
$boolean_flag = (bool) $any_variable;
</pre>
<p>I like the importance the double exclamation marks trigger when you read this in code. IT'S LIKE WHEN PEOPLE WRITE MUNDANE STUFF IN CAPS!!</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
//I'm clearly iterating towards 0
$counter = 100;
while($counter<strong>--&gt;</strong>0) {
	//do stuff
}
//does the same as
$counter = 100;
while($counter &gt; 0) {
	$counter--;
	//do stuff
}
</pre>
<p>This one's great, too. The arrow seems to make the loop a very dynamic element. Great, have I really just explained my joke post? Shocking, I must get out more. If you've been inside for too long, let me know what unusual syntax you've come across.</p>

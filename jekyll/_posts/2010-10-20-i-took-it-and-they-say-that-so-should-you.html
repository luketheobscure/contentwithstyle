While the excited and slightly stern style of invitation is not so much to my liking, I've taken <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/survey2010">this survey</a> every year since inception, and reading the <a href="http://aneventapart.com/alasurvey2009/">previous year's results</a> is always interesting. For me it's a good benchmark and prompts me to take stock over what I'm doing right now, and what I want to look for in the near future... you know, that question they always ask you in job interviews!
</p>
<p>A List Apart started this survey in 2007 because they felt that us web workers weren't statistically captured enough, something I agree very strongly with. Here's what they have to say about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s why each year since 2007, we’ve asked you, the members of the web design community, a few dozen questions about your professional life, and compared your answers to those of your colleagues. Each time we’ve asked, over 30,000 of you have kindly obliged with details about your salary, location, background, and more. The data that you provide and we analyze is the only significant information about our profession as a profession to be published anywhere, by anyone. [...] And so, as you have in years past, we ask that you please take a few minutes to complete this year’s survey.</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, I've got nothing else to say today but to tell you:

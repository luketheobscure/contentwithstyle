<p>
I am coding in node.js at the moment, and one thing drives me mad:
The constant need to nest or pass callbacks. 
So I did a little research on some libraries that help.
</p>

<p>
Two libraries in particular seemed to do what I was looking for: <a href="https://github.com/caolan">caolan's</a> <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">async</a> and <a href="https://github.com/creationix">creatonix</a> <a href="https://github.com/creationix/step">step</a>.
 
Both provide similar interfaces to end the callback bonanza.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/pascalopitz/async_experiments">little experiments on github</a>, that show how those two libraries can be used.</p>

    <p>upgrade PHP (or be very careful!) when using parent:: in combination with the __call and __callStatic magic methods, you might expect it to work differently.</p>

<p>So, this app I hadn't been looking at in a few months did not work at all. I traced the bug down to a method that itself called a parent method. The parent only contains __call and __callStatic methods, and for some reason __callStatic was called, although the class it was called from was an object instance.</p>
<p>To isolate the case I used the code example <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#language.oop5.overloading.methods">provided in the PHP manual</a>, extended it and ooo'd and ahh'd at the result.</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
class MethodTest {
    public function __call($name, $arguments) {
        // Note: value of $name is case sensitive.
        echo &quot;Calling object method &#x27;$name&#x27; &quot;
             . implode(&#x27;, &#x27;, $arguments). &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    
    public static function __callStatic($name, $arguments) {
        // Note: value of $name is case sensitive.
        echo &quot;Calling static method &#x27;$name&#x27; &quot;
             . implode(&#x27;, &#x27;, $arguments). &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
}

class MethodTestExtended extends MethodTest {
    public function runExtendedTest($var){
        parent::runTest($var);
    }
}

$obj = new MethodTest;
$obj-&gt;runTest(&#x27;in object context&#x27;);
//Calling object method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in object context
MethodTest::runTest(&#x27;in static context&#x27;);
//Calling static method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in static context

$obj = new MethodTestExtended;
$obj-&gt;runTest(&#x27;in object context&#x27;);
//Calling object method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in object context
MethodTestExtended::runTest(&#x27;in static context&#x27;);
//Calling static method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in static context

$obj = new MethodTestExtended;
$obj-&gt;runExtendedTest(&#x27;in object context&#x27;);
// PHP 5.3.3: Calling object method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in static context
// __callStatic is called, and $this is not available.
// PHP 5.3.4: Calling object method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in object context
// __call is called, and $this is available.
MethodTestExtended::runExtendedTest(&#x27;in static context&#x27;);
//Calling static method &#x27;runTest&#x27; in static context, with a 
//Strict Standards warning, though (as the method isn&#x27;t declared static)

</pre>
<p>The call is always routed via __callStatic, when called from within the extending class, regardless if it's in a static or object context, but not so when called directly.</p>
<p>Not believing my eyes, I started searching more creatively, and found that I was not the only one complaining about it; and luckily <a href="http://www.serverphorums.com/read.php?7,220473">the right people thought so, too</a>.</p>
<p>It so turns out that this behaviour was introduced in PHP 5.3.3, as part of another <a href="http://bugs.php.net/51176">bug dealing with the opposite desired behaviour</a> (calling class methods statically when in an object context), and removed again in PHP 5.3.4, smelling <a href="http://bugs.php.net/52713">a little bit like a bug</a>. A simple sudo port upgrade php5 did the job, bumping my install up to 5.3.4, and everything worked as intended. Yay!</p>
